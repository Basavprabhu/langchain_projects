Adoption of Technology for Scheme  Administration : \\n2.1  In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of \\n India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal  (NCIP) ( www.  pmfby.gov.in ). This \\n will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz.  Farmers, States, \\n Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.  \\n2.2  The successful  running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who \\n will have the  responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code \\n mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login c redential module.  \\n2.3  Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and \\n upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum \\ninsured, Govt. subsidy , and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance \\nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc.,  well within the prescribed time.

For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest \\n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.   \\n• Crop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such a s \\nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi -physical modelling approach can also be used \\nfor crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated \\nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolutio n, at least 5 km.  \\n• Identification of Outliers : All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any \\nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. \\nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remo te sensing vegetation indices (single or \\ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, \\nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.  \\nWhatever, yield proxi es to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record \\ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the \\nparticular crop’s yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield pro xy map. Both \\nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4 -5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, \\nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 \\nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be conside red, as outliers.  \\n• Computing Yield for the Outliers : For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield \\nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long -term \\nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote \\nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated. ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\merged.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

The \\nweightage to be g iven to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or \\nModel).

Similarly lower weightage to be given model estim ates, if \\nmodel is statistically not highly significant.

Use   of   Innovative Technologies  \\n20.1  To Rationalize CCEs:  With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging \\ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.  \\nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference \\nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the \\ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health . This feature can be successfully used to target \\nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’ \\n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number  of CCEs, to make them \\nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce  the total need of CCEs by about \\n30-40%  while maintaining similar accuracy . It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it \\nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU an d not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this \\ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in \\ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For  \\nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under \\nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, \\npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to \\nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized \\ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be \\nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop \\nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a \\nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This  can be done in consultation \\nwith MNCFC, NRSC  (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department  has also been piloting such \\nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.  \\n20.2  To remove Area Discrepancy in c overage:  It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, \\narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, \\ndigitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this d etailed \\nprocedure has been laid down in section  25  \\n20.3  For Direct Yield Estimation  \\n20.3.1   For addressing the issue of r eliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy , representativeness and \\ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as  satellite remote sensing , drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real \\ntime transmission of data etc. should  be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and \\ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international \\norganizations, including MNC FC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the \\nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various \\nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and \\nsupport timely claim processing and payments.  \\n20.3.2   States, with the support of nation al centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out \\nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mention ed ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\merged.pdf', 'page': 92}),\n",

Acreage discrepancy  \\n25.1  Some  areas  in the past  have  reported  excess  insurance  coverage  vis-à-vis planted  acreage,  leading to over -\\ninsurance.   Ideally  the discrepancy  should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers \\nwith genuine insurance  coverage.  All suitable  measures  are being taken  by concerned stakeholders for \\nde duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and \\nproposal/loan application of insured farmers.

Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts.  As per 2016 \\nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 \\nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost \\n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability \\nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower \\nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.  \\n2.  Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for \\nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop \\nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby \\nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived \\nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to \\ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level \\nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO - NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned \\ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in \\nclustering.  \\n3.  These are only for guidance of States  and States are free to follow either of these or any other method \\ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.  \\n4.

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop \\nInsurance Program (www.pmfby.go v.in)  \\n36.1   The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’  viz. farmers, Insurance Companies, \\nfinancial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration, \\ncoordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.  \\n36.2  The idea behind develo ping a web -based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify \\nfragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide \\nfaster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance \\n(www.pmfby.gov.in)  and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for \\ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of \\nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is \\nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby \\nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/lay ered information \\naccess, manual interventions, multi -step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective \\ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and \\nyield/weather data providers with N ational Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching \\nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst \\nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the \\nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it \\nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is \\navailable in two languages  – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.  \\n36.3  The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate \\nadministrative functions. A web -based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a \\nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically -weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance \\nservices.  \\n36.4  The conceptualisation and development of web -portal has already been completed and launched \\nhowever devel opment and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below \\nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.   \\n36.4.1   Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance \\nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed \\nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay -Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation \\nof funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement.  \\n36.4.2   Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company:  For \\nseamless and real- time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance  Companies will be \\nestablished. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange \\nplatform.  ', metadata={'source': 'document\\\\merged.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

The \\nsame digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal \\nfollowed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This \\nfacility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is \\nprevalent currently.  \\n36.4.4   Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic \\nWeather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges acro ss the country will be procured from IMD and \\nintegrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real- time monitoring of weather \\nparameters, agro -climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid -term \\nadversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather \\ndata to concerned Ins urance Companies and automated claim  calculation and remittance to \\nbeneficiaries.

Spots also appear on sheath. Severely infected nursery and field appear as burnt. Black \\nlesions appear on nodes girdling them . The affected nodes may break up and all the plant parts \\nabove the infected nodes may die (nodal blast).  \\nDuring flower emergence, the fungus attacks the peduncle and the lesion turns to \\nbrownish -black which is referred to as rotten neck / neck rot / panic le blast (neck blast ). \\nIn early neck infection, grain filling does not occur while in late infection, partial grain \\nfilling occurs. Small brown to black spots may also be observed on glumes of the heavily \\ninfected panicles.
