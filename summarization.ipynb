Objective of the Scheme  \\n Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture \\nsector by way of  \\n• Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events  \\n• Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming  \\n• Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices  \\n• Ensuring flow of c redit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop \\ndiversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides p rotecting \\nfarmers from production risks.  \\n2.  Adoption of Technology for Scheme  Administration : \\n2.1  In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of \\n India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal  (NCIP) ( www.  pmfby.gov.in ). This \\n will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz.  Farmers, States, \\n Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.  \\n2.2  The successful  running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who \\n will have the  responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code \\n mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login c redential module.  \\n2.3  Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and \\n upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum \\ninsured, Govt. subsidy , and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance \\nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc.,  well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate \\nfarmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. Sta te \\nGovt. and concerned Insurance  Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions \\netc. \\n2.4  Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender \\ndocuments which will be followed by entry of bid ded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance \\nCompany immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.  \\n2.5  Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and \\nseamless flow of data/information/reports  on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to \\ncreate/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.  \\n2.6  All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the \\n Portal for administration of the Scheme. De tails of operationalization of modules for each \\n stakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  2 2.7  Secured credential/login, preferably linked with Aadhaar Number and mobile OTP based, for all \\n Stakeholders viz, Central Governmen t, State Governments, Banks, empanelled Insurance Companies \\n and their designated field functionaries will be provided on the Portal to enable them to \\n enter/upload/download the requisite information.  \\n2.8  Insurance Companies shall not distribute/collect/allo w any other proforma/utility/web Portal etc for \\n collecting details of insured farmers separately. However they may provide all requisite support to \\n facilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer’s  details on the Portal well within the \\n prescribed  cut-off dates.  \\n2.9  Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for \\n Insurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released \\n accordingly.  \\n2.10  All data pertaining to crop -wise, area- wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area , coverage \\n and claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop \\n Insurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim c alculation etc.  \\n2.11  Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s \\n data electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to \\n undertake CBS integration in a t ime bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.  \\n2.12   It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention \\n Scheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real tim e \\n sharing of information and better program monitoring.  \\n2.13  Insurance Companies  shall compulsorily use technology/ mobile  applications for monitoring of crop \\n health/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also \\n facilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones  by way of prior approval of \\n agency from which such data can be sourced. This is  required for better monitoring and ground -\\n truthing.   ICs can be active partners  in facilitating use of technology.  \\n2.14  States shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such \\n as crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other \\n related technology for CCE planning, yield  estimation, loss assessment, assessment  of prevented \\n sowing and clustering of districts.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  3 3.  Coverage of Farmers  \\n3.1  All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas \\n are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured \\n crops. The non -loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land \\n records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/ \\n or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State \\n Govt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective \\n States in the notification itself.  \\n3.1.1  Compulsory Component  \\n3.1.1.1  All farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial \\nInstitutions  (FIs) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily. \\nThis provision sha ll override any decision taken by FIs including PACS exempting farmers from \\ncompulsory coverage of loanee farmers.  \\n3.1.1.2  However non -standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned \\nBanks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered c ompulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate  such   \\nfarmers for enrolment as non -loanee farmers .  \\n3.1.1.3  Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/ jewel  \\nloans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and \\nnotified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme.  \\n3.1.2  Voluntary Component  \\n• The Scheme is optional for non -loanee farmers.  \\n• The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt. \\nnotification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.   \\n3.1.3  Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage  of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the \\n Scheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved  in extension and awareness \\n creation amongst farmers and obtaining feed -back of farmers about the implementation of the \\n Scheme  \\n3.1.4  The implementing Insur ance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary \\nmeasures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non -loanee farmers. However \\nother empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen fo r \\nenrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non -loanee farmers at L1 \\npremium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days \\nof finalisation of tender/ issuance  of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the \\nInsurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in \\nthe given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be \\ntaken up on a pilot basis in D istricts notified by State Govt.  They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  4 conditions laid down in Para 17.5 .  \\n3.1.5  These Insurance Company will maintain separate data of such non loanee farmers covered by them \\nand enter the said d ata on the portal as per seasonality discipline detailed in Para 16.2. They shall be \\nliable for payment of claims to such farmers.  \\n3.1.6  The exchan ge of information, co -witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by \\nGovernment/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to \\naccept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non -loanee \\nenrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency.  \\n4.  Coverage of C rops  \\nI. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses),  \\nII. Oilseeds  \\nIII. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.  \\n In addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops \\nfor which standard methodology for yield estimation is available.  \\n5.  Coverage of Risks and Exclusions  \\n5.1  Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new \\n risks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted.  \\n5.1.1  Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/ \\n planting/germination  due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions.  \\n5.1.2  Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is prov ided to cover yield losses \\n due to non -preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease \\n attack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone.  \\n5.1.3  Post -Harvest Losses:  Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting, \\n for those crops which are  required  to be dried  in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field \\n after harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone , Cyclo nic rains and Unseasonal rains.  \\n5.1.4  Localized  Calamities:  Loss/damage  to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified \\n localized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and N atural fire due to lightening \\n affecting isolated farms in the notified area.  \\n5.1.5  Add- on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing  \\n add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be \\n substantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be \\n issued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry  of Environment and Forest and GIC Re.  The  \\n add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable  notiona l premium  will be borne  by the  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  5  farmer,  however  the State Govts  may  consider  providing  additional  subsidy  on this coverage,  \\n wherever  notified.  The  actuarial premium  rates  for add-on coverage  should  be sought  in the bid \\n itself from  the  Insurance  Companies,  however  the  add-on actuarial premium   rate will be \\n considered separately  and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.     \\n5.1.6  General Exclusions:  Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other \\n preventable risk s shall be excluded.  \\n5.1.7  State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above \\n which is  not prevailing in their State/UT  \\n5.1.8  Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of \\n individual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies \\n is essential. For remaining risks losses are due t o wide spread calamit ies. Hence lodging of \\n information for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is  \\n not essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield \\n submitted by concerned Stat e Govt.  \\n6.  Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme  \\n6.1  States:  \\n  Issuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply \\n their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions \\n relating to PMFBY which are binding on States/ UTs are as follows:  \\n6.1.1  Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct \\n of CCEs through CCE -Agri App  and use of  NCIP platform for  flow of information and auto \\n administration of the scheme   \\n6.1.2  State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified \\n insurance unit area;  \\n6.1.3  CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance \\n Company within the notified cut off date ;  \\n6.1.4  State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision  for  premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at \\n the beginning of the crop season;  \\n6.1.5  To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology.  \\n6.1.6  Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National \\n Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated \\n as Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop \\n Insurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAI S and NCIP* may be authorized to \\n oversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  6  constitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present \\n composition of SLCCCI  may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture \\n Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’ \\n Representatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI \\n may  co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.  \\n6.2  Insurance Company:  \\n  Empanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme \\n (PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The \\n empanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for \\n implementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified maj or activities:  \\n6.2.1  To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in  a \\n transparent manner,  \\n6.2.2  Deployment of requisite  infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,  \\n6.2.3  Commitment for  at least 10  % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,  \\n6.2.4  Deployment of sufficient manpower to co -observe CCEs and allied activities  and compulsory use of \\n CCE Co -observation app ,  \\n6.2.5  Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and \\n capacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be \\n submitted to Cent ral and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season.  \\n6.3  Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:  \\n6.3.1  Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards. \\n Therefore, all banks are  advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same \\n applies for non -loanee farmers enrolled through banks/Insuran ce companies/insurance \\n intermediaries.  \\n6.3.2  Farmers not having A adhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for \\n Aadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February, \\n 2017 issued by GOI under Se ction 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other \\n Subsidies, Benefits and Services).  Copy  of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in . This \\n may be  subject to further directions issued  by Govt. from time to time.  \\n6.3.3  All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification \\nunder  Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage \\n of loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the \\n concerned bank branch regularly . \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  7 7.  Notification  \\n7.1  Procedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs:  \\n7.1.1  Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous \\n year, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of \\n bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled In surance Companies for selection to implement the \\nScheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT  Govt.  should ensure the issuance of the notification and \\nits circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of \\nthe commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, \\nareas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops, \\nperiod of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection met hodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt. \\nsubsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be \\nissued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year  \\n7.1.2 In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the \\ndetails as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State \\nNotification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tende r document shall \\nbe allowed post tendering.  \\n7.1.3 Bidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at \\nnotified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template \\nand should be made part of the Tender.  \\n7.1.4 Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified \\ncrops in each district during last year/season . However, in absence of insured area of last year/season \\nfor all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of \\nweighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only.  \\n7.1.5 Bidding shall  be done through e -tendering  and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the \\nopening of the Tender.  \\n7.1.6 Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in \\ndistrict(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by \\nbidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on \\npremium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding \\nperiod. However, recourse to this ceiling  provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as \\na general practice. The ceiling  premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial \\npremium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and  name of such crop should be disclosed by State \\nGovt. compulsorily in the tender document.  \\n7.1.7 In such cases where a ceiling  has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step \\nbidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is fo r disclosing the premium rate offered by \\neach participating Insurance Company for such ceiling  crops and must be categorised under “ Ceiling   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  8 Premium Rate” and  2nd  bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all crops included in \\ntender. Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the \\nbidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies \\nhave to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above.  \\n7.1.8 State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each \\nindividual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the \\ncrop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating \\nInsurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by \\nthe State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered \\nfor left o ut/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after \\ndecision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating \\nInsurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed \\ncrop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate” \\nfrom the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all \\ncrops/remaining crops.  \\n7.1.9 States should av oid doing re -tendering as a general practice. Re -tendering may be held only in \\nexceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI  after submission of a request with \\ndetailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the \\nrequest.  \\n7.1.10  States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums, \\nrequisite data  and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster \\ncommunication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also \\nbe uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.  \\n7.1.11   All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself \\n and no n ew condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any \\n Tender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a \\n copy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender   \\n7.1.12   L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1 \\n bidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment  of \\n work to others, due to increase  in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall  be \\n recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.  \\n7.2  Notification of  Crops,  Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)  \\n7.2.1 The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called \\nInsurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT  will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in \\naccordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village \\nPanchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for maj or crops  defined at District / \\nTaluka or equivalent level.  For other crops  it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village  \\nPanchayat. For defining a crop as a major crop for deciding the Insurance Unit level, the sown area of  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  9 that crop should be at least 25% of Gross Cropped Area in a District/  Taluka or equivalent level  \\n7.2.2 For the claims arising out of crop damage due to post -harvest  losses and localized risks, assessment of \\ndamage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in (Section 2 1, para 21.4 and 21.5 \\nrespectively).  \\n7.2.3 SLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based \\non CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 7 years for calculation of threshold yield), cropped \\nacreage an d capacity for estimating yield during proposed s eason, etc. State govt. should endeavour to \\ncover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State. States should ensure that a standard \\nmethodology of yield estimation exists for all the crops proposed to be notified  \\n7.2.4 State Govt./ UT should provide 10 years’ historical yield data in soft format(in E xcel) in English  to \\nInsurance Companies for calculation of threshold yield , premium rates etc. at insurance unit area  \\nand in its absence, data at next  higher unit/nearest neighbouring unit/weighted average of contiguous \\nunits, as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified area of insurance unit \\nmust be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.  \\n7.2.5 In case State Govts /UT proposes to notify irrigated and un -irrigated areas under a crop separately, \\nthey shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un -irrigated crops \\nseparately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made \\navailable separately for both  \\n7.2.6 While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such \\nas in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State N odal Department to use the \\nrelevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while \\nreleasing the Tender Document  and submiss ion of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible \\nclaims. Insurance Compan ies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document. \\nInformation/ data  provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in c ase of any error/ \\nmisreporting/ disparity , State Govt . and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment  of \\nadditional claims arising on account of it, if any.  \\n7.2.7 For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi -year contract), the States, if required, can \\nnotify additional IUs or de -notify  certain IUs  subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already no tified \\nIUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut- off date for debit of \\npremium. If the  deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be \\nworked out either by calculation of weighted avera ge premium rate as prevalent in contiguous \\ndistricts  or  by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will \\nbe determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs.  \\n7.2.8 States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for \\n50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved \\ntechnology  from GOI.  Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement.  The data source for \\ncalculation of admissibility of incremental CCEs will be the National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  10 7.3 Notification of Indemnity Level, Average Yield and Threshold Yield  \\n7.3.1 Three levels of Indemnity, viz.,  70%, 80% and 90%. SLCCCI in consultation  with Insurance Companies \\nshall approve indemni ty levels for notified crops at  district level. Threshold Yield (TY) shall be notified \\nin the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season.\\n The Average Yield of  a notified crop in Insurance Unit (IU) will be average yield of best five years out of \\nlast seven years. The Threshold yield of  the notified crop is equal to Average Yield multiplied by \\nIndemnity level. The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU shall compul sorily be part of the notification \\nfor the season and shall not change at any point during that season.  \\n7.3.2 Calculation and Notification of Threshold Yield: For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average \\nyield of best five out of last seven years shall be considered.  Further Threshold Yield should be defined \\nonly at notified area level and once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be \\nchanged at later stage under any circumstances.  In case of multi -year contract, the Threshold Yield for \\nthe subsequent years shall be revised by adding/considering the yields of immediate previous \\ncorresponding season. The revised TY and Sum Insured (if revised) should be notified accordingly at \\nthe beginning of each crop season in case of multi -year tender.   \\n7.4 Notification of Seasonality discipline:  \\n7.4.1 State Govt./ UT  in accordance  with the broad seasonality defined/prescribed in the Operational \\nGuidelines shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz. \\nsubmission of insurance proposals/application, consolidated de clarations by banks, remittance of \\npremium to Insurance Companies, uploading of individual covered farmer’s data on National Crop \\nInsurance Portal, submission of yield data, claim assessment of losses for(i) standing crop(ii) localized \\ncalamities,(iii) pre vented sowing, iv) post harvest losses, (v) On -Account payment for major calamities, \\netc as per the provisions of the Scheme.  \\n *In exceptional cases, where last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of\\n Bidding/Notification, yield dat a is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However \\n the yield data upto last to last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself. \\n However, in such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the bas is of yield data of last 7 \\n years only.  \\n7.5  Notification of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)  \\n7.5.1  Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which \\nare as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/ any agency  to be \\nnotified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real \\ntime  weather data.  AWS/ARG    of private agencies  should only be considered in absence of properly \\nfunctioning AWS/ARGs of  IMD/  State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be \\ntransferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data \\non the Portal will be circulated separately.  \\n7.5.2  State govt can explore the possibilit y to create dense AWS/ARG network on PPP Mode for wh ich GOI \\nwill provide 50% of the  viability gap funding.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  11  \\n7.5.3  The following data sources may  be used for validation of on account   claims and claims for prevented \\nsowing:  \\n• Satellite/UAV Remote  Sensing Data  \\n• AWS/ARG Data  \\n• MNCFC Report/Study  on drought assessment  \\n7.5.4  State Govt. shall notify concerned weather data provider/ expert agency whose report/ methodology \\n would be used in assessing the extent of losses and computation of claims. Cost of such weather data \\n shall be borne by the concerned Insurance Companies . The notified AWS and ARG should fulfil/ meet \\n the standards/ norms/ criteria specified by the concerned authorities from time to time.  \\n8.  Engagement of Common Service Centres (CSCs) and I ntermediaries \\nfor coverage of Non -Loanee Farmers:  \\n8.1  CSCs u nder Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (M eITY ) have been engaged to enrol \\n non-loanee farmers. The Insurance Companies are required to enter into a separate agreement with \\n CSC and pay service charges  as fixed by DAC&FW, GOI per farmer per village per season. No other \\n agreement or payment is required to be made for this purpose. Nodal agency for engagement with \\n Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Insurance Companies will be CSC -SPV, a com pany \\n established under M eITY for carrying out e -governance initiatives of GoI.  \\n8.2  No charges/f ee shall be borne or paid by the farmers being enrolled through CSCs i.e. CSC -SPV and \\n CSC-VLE \\n8.3  As per IRDA circular, no separate qualification/certification will be required for the VLEs of CSCs to \\n facilitate enrolment of non -loanee farmers.  \\n8.4  All empanelled Insurance Companies will compulsorily be required to enter into an agreement with \\n CSC for enrolment of non -loanee farmers and for provision of other defined s ervices to farmers.  \\n8.5  Other designated intermediaries may be linked with the Portal in due course.  \\n8.6  Empanelled Insurance Companies have to necessarily register on the portal and submit list and details \\n of agents/intermediaries engaged for enrolment of no n-loanee farmers in the beginning of each \\n season  within 10 days of award of work in the State.  Further all agents/intermediaries have to work \\n strictly as per the provisions of the Scheme and IRDA regulations  \\n9.  Electronic Remittance of Funds  \\n9.1  Govt. of India and State Govt. will endeavour to utilize Public Financial Management System \\n (PFMS)/PFMS linked systems to remit the funds to State Govt/agencies  \\n9.2 Banks, CSC and Insurance Agents are required to remit the premium payment to respective Insurance  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  12 Company mandatorily through Payment gateway (Pay -Gov) of National Crop Insurance Portal or \\nthrough RTGS/NEFT followed by mandatory uploading of payment detail s on National Crop Insurance \\nPortal within stipulated date. Bank details of Insurance Companies shall be made available on National \\nCrop Insurance Portal itself. Accordingly, all Stakeholders including Insurance Companies, Bank \\nbranches, CSC and Insurance Agents must compulsorily maintain dedicated bank accounts for this \\npurpose. No remittance/financial transaction in the form of Banker’s cheque/Demand Draft will be \\nallowed.  \\n9.3 Insurance companies will be provided login access to the essential crop notificatio n data/information \\nalong with farmer level coverage data including banking details of individual farmers on the National \\nCrop Insurance Portal to reconcile, verify, validate and calculate payable claims and remit  the same \\ndirectly into pre -declared bank a ccounts linked to the National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n10.  Census Code Mapping of Entities;  \\n10.1  All States shall map census codes of their villages with the higher administrative/revenue units like \\nGram Panchayat, Firkas, Patwar Circles, Revenue Circles, Hoblis, Mandals, Blocks, Tehsils,  Talukas, \\nDistricts and Automatic Weather Stations/Backup Weather Stations. This will create a standard \\nmechanism of mapping and identification across the country.   \\n10.2  Further, for purposes of obtaining accurate location, State Gov ts. must also provide geo coded  \\n(latitude. & longitude) village maps on digital format for integration with other Apps like CCEs Agri \\nApp, Loss reporting/Assessment App etc.  \\n11.  Digitization of Land Records  \\n11.1  State Govts. are advised to digitize their revenue records using village Census codes so that the \\nindividual land records of farmers can be accessed through the National Crop Insurance Portal for crop \\ninsurance. This will help the Govt. to reach and identify individual beneficiaries and bring utmost \\ntrans parency and authenticity in benefit transfer.  \\n12.  Sum Insured /Coverage Limit  \\n12.1  Sum Insured per hectare for both loanee and non -loanee farmers will be same and equal to the Scale \\nof Finance as decided by the DLTC/SLTC, and would be pre -declared by SLCCCI and notified. No other \\ncalculation of Scale of Finance will be applicable. Sum Insured for individual fa rmer is equal to the SOF \\nper hectar e mult iplied by a rea of the notified crop proposed by the farmer for insurance. Area under \\ncultivation shall always be expressed in hectare’.  \\n12.2  In cases where crops are separately notified under irrigated, un -irrigated category by State Govts. Sum \\ninsured for irrigated and un -irrigated areas should be separately  indicated . \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  13 13.  Premium Rates and Premium Subsidy  \\n13.1  The Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) would be charged under PMFBY by implementing Insurance \\n Company. The rate of premium payable by the farmer will be as per the following T able  1: \\nSeason  Crops  Maximum Premium payable by farmer (% of \\nSum Insured)*  \\nKharif  All food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \\nPulses and Oilseeds crops)  2.0% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\nRabi  All food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \\nPulses and oilseeds)  1.5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \\nKharif and \\nRabi  Annual Commercial/ Annual Horticultural crops  5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\nPerennial horticultural crops (pilot basis)  5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\n * Premium paid by non loanee farmers should be rounded off in Rupee terms  \\n13.2  Payment of Govt. Subsidy:  \\n13.2.1   The difference between A ctuarial Premium  Rate and the rate of Insurance premium payable by \\n farmers shall be treated as Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally by the \\n Centre and State Govts. However, the State/ UT Govts. are free to extend additional subsidy over and \\n above the normal subsidy from its budget. In other words, additional subsidy, if any shall be borne \\n entirely by the State/ UT Govt.  Subsidy in premium is  allowed only to the extent of Sum Insured . \\n13.2.2   Govt. premium subsidy to the Private empanelled Insurance Companies may be routed  through \\n Agricultural Insurance Company  (AIC) or any agency designated by GOI strictly as per the \\n guidelines/order of the Govt . This may be reviewed later by Central Govt. and changed  according ly if \\n necessary. Accordingly, AIC/ other designated agency is empowered to call/ collect all requisite \\n information related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Govt. funds and to share \\n the same with the Govt for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. The \\n premium subsidy will be routed through PFMS/PFMS linked systems strictly based on the MIS \\n generated through National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n13.2.3   Govt, both Centre and State,  will  release their share of advance subsidy (First Instalment) equivalent \\n to 50% of 80% of their respective share of subsidy in corresponding previous season subject to \\n fulfilment of General Financial Rule(GFR)/guidelines in the matter without waiting for coverage \\n details  for the ongoing  season.  \\n13.2.4   To facilitate settlement of prevented risk/ mid season adversity/localized claims: ICs should release the \\n admissible claim amount to the beneficiary immediately after receipt of farme rs premium and \\n advance subsidy ( 1st Instalment) and without waiting for release of final subsidy (Second Instalment) \\n from  Govt. The  premium in  respect of affected IUs including subsidy to enable settlement of \\n claims arising due to above events in res pect of all such beneficiaries shall be adjusted from the fund \\n already  available with ICs as advance upfront subsidy (First Instalment) to facilitate compliance of \\n Section 64 B  of Insurance Act/Regulation of IRDAI   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  14 13.2.5   All admissible claims  based on Yield data/Post harvest losses will be settled on  receipt of second \\n installment of Govt. subsidy to be paid on the basis of tentative business statistics generated on the \\n portal after 15 days of period specified for auto approval of application s on the Portal. The remaining \\n Govt. subsidy, if any will be paid after reconciliation of all business statistics for the season on portal.  \\n13.2.6   All empanelled insurance companies including private insurance companies shall provide free access \\n to the Cen tral/State level agencies including CAG authorized to verify the accounts and audit in \\n respect of Crop Insurance.  \\n13.2.7   In case, the State Govt.  subsidizes full farmers’ share of premium, in that case a token amount of at \\n least Re. 1 should compulsorily be charge d from the farmer to facilitate electronic tracking.  \\n13.2.8   State Govt. has to release the State share of premium subsidy within 3 months from premium \\n requisition by concerned Insurance Company failing which 1% interest per month shall be levied as \\n penalty on the State govt.  \\n13.3  Payment of Claim Liabilities:  \\n13.3.1   Insurance company shall take all necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their \\nportfolio in order to safeguard insured’s interest. In case premium to claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or \\npercentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a crop \\nseason, then Govt. will provide protection to Insurance Companies. The losses exceeding the above \\nmentioned level in the crop season would be met from equal contrib ution of the Central Govt. and the \\nconcerned State/UT Govts. In case losses are below the above mentioned condition, insurers shall be \\nresponsible to settle the admissible claims.  \\n14.  Budget for Administrative Expenses  \\n14.1   At least 2% of the total budget for PMFBY shall be earmarked by State/UTs for administrative \\n expenses, publicity, yield/loss assessment expenses, purchase of smart phones, adoption of new \\n technology, setting up of State Technical Support Unit (STSU), tra velling and contingency fund.  \\n14.2  Govt. of India has already made provisions for separate allocations under sub heads like Salaries, \\nDomestic Travel Expenses , Technology interventions, Office Expenses , other Administrative Expenses  \\nand Professional S ervices etc. for Crop Insurance program under PMFBY/RWBCIS.  States should make \\nprovisions and  budget ary allocation on similar lines including subhead for incremental cost of CCEs.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  15 15.  Technical Support Unit (TSU)/ CPMU  \\n15.1  National Technical Support Unit (NTS U) or Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) will be created \\nat the Central level at the earliest to provide support and advise on risk classification & rating, \\ndevelopment of new products, methodology for loss assessment, legal works, workshop/training & \\ncapacity building, alongwith use of technology including innovation/ replication, digitisation of \\nadministration of Schemes through Crop Insurance Portal etc.  \\n15.2  NTSU shall calculate Loss Cost (LC) i.e. Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of \\nnotified crop(s) in notified unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/ \\nRabi) along with approximate actuarial premium rate of the crops proposed to be notified for the \\nseason. This loss cost/premium rate shall be based on the latest available yield data in month of \\nJanuary  for Kharif crops and July  for Rabi crops and shall be provided to DAC & FW/ Concerned States \\non request before invitation for premium bidding. This calculation to be done by NTSU on behalf of \\nDAC & FW  is only for official purposes to have information on the approximate cost to the IA for \\ncovering the risks so as to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.  \\n15.3  National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) may also develop a suitable methodology for risk \\nclassification/premium rating by using historical yield data, weather data, use and level of \\ninputs/irrigation/technology in crop cultivation, remote sensing data/information etc. for \\nstandardization of methodology for risk perception and premium rating fo r crop insurance in the \\ncountry.  \\n15.4  In addition to National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) / Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) \\nat Central level, all States/UTs implementing Schemes should also create a separate TSU/PMU at State \\nHQ level with sufficient technical experts/staff to ensure  proper implementation of the Scheme.  State \\nTSU (STSU) may also opt for members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other \\norganizations/research institutes etc as deemed fit. However, States shall have to allocate a separate \\nbudget for running the STSU.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  16 16.

Fo r this State Govts should send \\na formal intimation to GoI.  \\n16.4  In case of disruption of services due to natural events beyond human control or \\ntechnical/software/network issues with the National Crop Insurance Portal the subsequent dates  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  20 (other than the cut -off dates for Enrolment/Premium Debit/Collection) may be extended by the \\ncompetent authority on the basis of specific written inputs from Portal Development and Maintenance \\nAgency. However due care has to be taken that such extension does not lead to moral hazard and \\nmisuse of the Scheme and suitable measures should be put forth for the same accordingly.  \\n16.5  Further, in case of three crop s / season pattern, a modified seasonality discipline keeping in view the \\noverall seasonality discipline prescribed above, sh all be adopted by SLCCCI.  \\n16.6  Keeping in view the specifi c nature of crop and scope for catastrophic crop damage, SLCCCI shall fix \\nseasonality in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also \\nensure early payment of claims to eligible insured farme rs. Scheme also has provisions for claims \\ndue to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop. Hence, State  Govt. will take all \\nnecessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the Scheme. \\nNo request/relaxation for extension in the above seasonality/cut- off dates shall be considered/ \\ngranted by  GoI once it is fixed and notifie d for the crop season. However, preponement in cut off dates \\nshall be considered on case to case basis.

However, in case the States/ UT decide to do so, it may be done only \\nin agreement with implementing  Insurance Company. In such cases, however no central premium \\nsubsidy will be provided for the areas/farmers/crops which are covered/ insured in the extended \\nperiod and the concerned State has to bear the entire subsidy liability for the coverage in the \\nextended period.  \\n16.8  In a situation where total claims have been approved/auto approved, the company shall be liable to \\npay claims within 2 weeks of calculation/auto approval of claims irrespective of whether Insurance \\nCompanies have raised the bill for 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy or not. Hence, it is binding on the \\nInsurance Company to seek the 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy within the timelines.  \\n16.9  All admissible claims shall mandatorily be paid within the stipulated cutoff date failing which penal \\ninterest @ 12% per annum shall be payable on admissible pending claims beyond 30 days of uploading \\nAY on portal/provided in soft copy by State Govt. subject to release of applicable subsidy by State \\nGovt . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  21 17.  Collection of Proposals and Premium from Farmers  \\n17.1  The Nodal Bank system adopted under NAIS/ NCIP* wherein the implementing Insurance Company is \\nnot required to deal with all the loan disbursing points and instead deals only with designated Nodal \\nbanks, will continue under PMFBY only for Cooperative Banks , However , for Commercial Banks/RRBs, \\nthe individual bank branches shall act as Nodal branch for this purpose. The concerned Lead bank and \\nRegional offices/ Administrative offices of Commercial banks/RRBs will provide necessary guidelines  to \\nconcerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches \\ncompulsorily remit the farmers premium electronically through NEFT/RTGS to be routed through NCIP \\nto concerned  Insurance Companies and submit the consolidated propo sals/information in prescribed \\nformat  well within the stipulated cut -off dates and also upload the details of individual \\ncovered/insured farmers  on National Crop Insurance  Portal. Besides, for the coverage of non -loanee \\nfarmers only, Insurance Company m ay also use IRDAI approved micro insurance agents/ insurance \\nintermediaries. However, details of such agents should compulsorily be submitted to State Govt. and \\nGovt. of India well before the start of the season for creating their credentials and subsequen t \\nuploading of details of individual insured/covered farmers on Portal within stipulated timelines.  \\n17.2  Consolidated declaration/ proposal formats to be submitted physically/ electronically by Nodal \\nbanks/Branches shall contain details about Insurance Unit, sum insured per unit, premium per unit, \\ntotal area insured of the farmers, number and category of farmers covered (small and marginal or \\nother)and number of farmers under other categories(SC/ST/others)/Women along with their bank \\naccount details etc.(bank/ their branches) as per the application form provided on the National Crop \\nInsurance Portal. Banks are required to upload the insured farmers’ data mandatorily on the National \\nCrop Insurance  Portal. No other platform shall be used for uploading/submission o f farmers’ data. \\nThose farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall only be eligible for \\nInsurance coverage and accordingly the premium subsidy will also be released. In cases where farmers   \\nare denied crop insurance due to i ncorrect/ partial/non -uploading of their details on Portal, concerned \\nBanks/Intermediaries shall be responsible for payment of claims to them  \\n17.3  In order  to facilitate  timely release of Govt. subsidy and remittance of claims to the farmers. entry \\nof detailed  information of all insured farmers on NCIP is  essential  fo r all bank  branches /PACS/ \\nCSCs/In termediaries/designated insurance agents  and Insurance Companies  \\n17.4  Loanee farmers (Compulsory coverage)  \\n17.4.1  Whenever banks sanction loan fo r a notified c rop in a no tified a rea, the crop l oan amount to the \\nextent of notifi ed Sum Insured (equivale nt to DLTC/SLTC approved Scale of Finance)  for notified \\ncrop and acreage of individual notified crop of loanee farmer shall be taken into consideration for \\ncompulsory coverage, as per seasonality discipline. Based on seasonality of crop, banks should \\nseparately calculate the eligibility of loan am ount for both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the Scale \\nof Finance and declared acreage under notified crops. Disbursing bank branch/ PACS  will prepare \\nstatement of crop -wise and insurance unit -wise details of crop insurance with premium as per the \\nseason ality discipline. Loan disbursing bank branch/ PACS shall finance additional loan equal to the \\npremium amount payable by farmer for crop insurance.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  22 17.4.2  For insurance coverage of a farmer, SI amount for a notified crop will be equivalent to Scale of Finance \\ndefined in the Govt. notification and uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal for the \\nconcerned notified crop and season. The total Sum Insured of loanee farmer for the season shall be \\ncalculated accordingly. The compulsory coverage shall solely be based on the  sanctioned / renewal of \\ncredit limit for notified crop for the season only and will be independent of disbursed \\namount/withdrawals. Farmers availing/renewing the KCC loans for Kharif & Rabi crops after cut -off \\ndate (renew/sanction period) for the season will be eligible for cover under crop insurance for the \\nnext/following crop season subject to the loan being standard loan and cut -off-date of premium debit \\nfor the season. In order to eliminate excess insurance and subsequent application of Area C orrection \\nFactor(ACF), care should be taken by the banks to ensure that only correct acreage under each \\ndeclared crop in loan application is considered for compulsory coverage of notified crop and not the \\nactual total acreage,. Banks will be liable for aud it and inspection on account of excess Insurance/ACF.  \\n17.4.3  Benefit of add on products viz., prevented sowing/ on account payment for Mid season adversity/ \\nlocalized calamity will be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium / the premium \\nhas bee n debited from their account before the damage notification by the State Govt. for invoking \\nthis provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure  that they debit farmers premium within 15 \\ndays from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks  will be liable to meet the claim \\nliabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium \\nat least one month before cut- off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction \\nhappens within one mon th of cut -off date, banks may daily debit premium for such accounts.  \\n17.4.4  Detailed example for C alculation of crop -wise Sum Insured for the season for compulsory coverage is \\ngiven in Table 3 below:   \\n  Crop 1  Crop 2  Crop 3  Crop 4  Crop 5  Crop 6  \\nTotal Land Ownership (Ha)  8 \\nKharif  Rabi  \\nName of Crop  Paddy  Maize  Cotton  Wheat  Potato  Gram  \\nActual Sown Area (Ha) under the crop 5 2 1 6 1 1 \\nArea (Ha) declared in KCC application  2 1 1 2 1 1 \\nCrop Season  Kharif  Rabi  \\nScale of Finance (Rs./Ha)  50,000  40,000  60,000  50,000  70,000  30,000  \\nTotal Sanctioned Sub limit for crop cultivation  1,00,000  40,000  60000  1,00,000  70,000  30,000  \\nSeason -wise sub limit for crop cultivation  2,00,000  2,00,000  \\nAdditional loan amount for consumption and \\nmaintenance of machinery etc (max.

It is the responsibility of \\nbank branch to complete the application of farmer. In case the farmers is unable to fill the \\napplication, bank branch is responsible for filling the application on farmer’s behalf, so that not a \\nsingle farmer who desires to take crop insurance coverage is left out from the purview of crop \\ninsurance Scheme  \\n17.5.3  In case submitted through CSCs, farmer will be required to authenticate herself/himself using Aadhaar \\nfor filling up online application form. Having a bank account is  essential for such cases. CSC will upload \\nall requisite/desired supporting documents on Portal while filling up the application form on behalf of \\nthe farmer. Applications without requisite documents would not be considered for insurance coverage \\nand CSC -VLE is responsible for proper filling of application form.  \\n17.5.4  CSC/Branch/ PACS officials will assist the farmers in completing the insurance proposal form and \\nprovide necessary guidance. While accepting the applications and premium, CSC/Branch/ PACS will be \\nresponsible for verification of required documents, eligible sum insured, applicable premium rate, etc. \\nIn case of coverage through PACS, they will consolidate these particulars and send them directly/ to \\nrespective Nodal Bank Branches which will, in turn, s ubmit application details online on National Crop \\nInsurance Portal and submit crop -wise and insurance unit -wise declarations electronically in the \\nprescribed format, along with the e -remittance of premium using payment gateway/ RTGS/NEFT \\nmode, within the s tipulated time, to insurance company.  Besides CSCs, other Govt./  semi -Govt.  \\ninstitutions/organizations including Post offices are also proposed to be utilized for insurance of non -\\nloanee farmers after  their integration with the National Crop Insurance Po rtal after  obtaining \\napproval of competent authorities.  \\n17.5.5  Non -loanee cultivators could also be serviced directly by any designated agencies, other auth orized \\nchannel partners or insurance  intermediaries, approved by the IRDA for the purpose and they  will ac t \\nas a guide and f acilitator wherein  they  will advise such non l oanee cultivators  about the benefits  and \\ndesirability  of the Scheme and guide the farmers  about procedures; collect requisite premium and \\nremit individual/ consolidated premium electronicall y to insuranc e company , acco mpanied by individual  \\nproposal  forms  and summary details in declaration form  and upload details of each insured \\nfarmer compulsorily within stipula ted timelines on the NCIP.  \\n17.5.6  While  accepting the Proposal and the premium  from  aforesaid  designated agents, other authorized \\nchannel partner or insurance intermediaries approved by IRDA, it shall be the responsibility of \\nInsurance Company or its designated agents to verify insurable interest and collect the land records, \\nAadhaar Numb er., particulars of acreage, sum insured, crop sown  etc. and applicable  contract/  \\nagreement  details  in case  of share croppers/  tenant  farmers.  The designated  intermediaries  shall enter \\nthe data of farmers on web -portal,  remit  the premium with consolidated proposals within 2 days. \\nHowever, it is mandatory that the non -loanee cultivators serviced by the designated intermediaries  \\nshould  hold  a bank  account and Aadhaar No. or Aadhaar enrolment No. in order to get insured and the  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  25 designated intermediaries  will also facilitate remittance of the claim, if payable.  \\n17.5.7  For farmers bu ying crop ins urance through C SCs o r online, OTP/Aadhaar enabled verification shall be \\nconstrued as signature by the applicant for coverage under cro p insurance  \\n17.6  Non -loanee Farmers (Optional coverage) -  directly to Insurance Companies/Web Portal  \\n17.6.1  Non -Loanee  farmer may  submit  insurance  proposals  personally  - to Insurance Company with \\nrequisite/desired supporting documents and applicable  premium  has to be remitted electronically to \\nconcerned Insurance Company and details of UTR/remittance slips should compulsorily be attached \\nwith application. .   \\n17.6.2  Non -loan ee farm ers can al so submit appl ication forms f or get ting insurance coverage through web -Portal. \\nFor this, farmer can fill up the online application form available on crop insurance Portal \\n(www.pmfby.gov.in ) and pay the requisite premium through  paymen t gateway. A s soon as the \\napplication is submitted through the system, an acknowledgement  receipt will be generated alon g with \\na unique identifi cation number. Additionally, intimation  will also be sent through SMS on registered \\nmobile number of the farmer.  \\n17.6.3  However, it is mandatory that Non -Loanee farmers, personally submitting proposals to In surance \\nCompany or through National Crop I nsurance  Portal,  should  have  insurable  interest and submit  \\nnecessary  documentary evidence as proof as decided by SLCCCI along with Aadhaar no. or Aadhaar \\nenrolment No.  . The insured farmer loses the premium  and the right  to claim  (if any)  if the material  facts  \\nfurnished  in the proposal  form  are found to be wrong or incorrect at any subsequent point in time.  \\n17.6.4  Insurance companies retain the right to accept or reject insurance proposal(s) within 15 days/one \\nmonth of receipt of proposal for Loanee/Non loanee respectively , in case proposal is incomplete, not \\naccompanied by necessary documentary proof, Aadhaar no. or Aadhaar enrolment No./Slip  or insurance \\npremium ordinarily,. If the proposal is rejected, the Insurance C ompany will fully refund the collected \\npremium.  \\n17.7  Option for change of crop name  \\n17.7.1   Farmers covered, on voluntary basis, can buy insurance before actual sowing/ planting, based on \\nadvance crop planning. However, for any reason if a farmer changes the crop planned earlier, he \\nshould intimate the change to insurance company, up to 2 working days before the cut- off-date for \\nenrolment /buying insurance , through financial institution/channel partner/ insurance \\nintermediary/directly as the case may be, along with difference in premium payable, if any, \\naccompanied with sowing certificate issued by concerned village/ sub -district level official of the State. \\nIn case the premium paid was higher, Insurance Company will refund the excess premium.  \\n17.7.2   Similarly, loanee farmers  can also change the name of insured crop from the original crop indicated in \\nthe loan application but such change should be submitted in writi ng to the concerned bank branch up \\nto 2 working days before  cut-off date for enrolment and accordingly their newly proposed crop should \\nbe insured. However change of non -notified crop to notified crops without submitting the sowing \\ncertificate is not permi ssible. Bank will ensure that all standard loans (as defined by concerned \\nfinancial institutions) sanctioned/renewed for notified crops within stipulated cut -off date should \\ncompulsorily be covered.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  26 17.8  Declarations/ proposals and debited premium received by Insurance Companies from the Banks/ \\n PACS  after the cut -off date shall be summarily rejected and the liability, if any, for such declarations \\n shall rest with the concerned bank.  Accordingly the data/proposal entry on the National Crop \\n Insurance Portal will also be stopped after the applicable cut off date. However, any dispute in the \\n matter may be resolved as per the Grievance redressal mechanism detailed in Section 30 . \\n17.9 The con cerned branches of banks and Nodal Banks/ DCCBs in case of PACS will  upload the details of \\n individual insured farmers (both loanee and non -loanee) like farmer’s name, father’s name, Bank \\n Account number, Aadhaar Number, village, categories –  Small and Marginal/SC/ST/Women, insured \\n acreage, details of insured land, insured crop(s ) etc as prescribed in online application form. available \\non National Crop Insurance Portal or CBS integration module and submit the same within stipulated \\ncut-off date as per the  seasonality discipline/ The Banks/ PACS must also ensure the premium amount \\nis remitted to the concerned Insurance Company electronically within the stipulated time, failing \\nwhich they shall be responsible for payment of claims, if any to the farmers. How ever, any dispute in \\nthe matter may be referred to the State Govt. by the concerned Agency/Bank for taking appropriate \\naction within the prescribed cut off date for reconciliation of premium by banks with all details.  \\n17.10   Insurance companies shall upload req uisite information including necessary documentation in respect \\nof non -loanee farmers enrolled through channel partner other than CSCs on the National Crop \\nInsurance Portal within the stipulated date of c overage of non loanee farmers . All intermediaries sh all \\nensure that the documentation is complete in all respect before accepting the premium. It is the \\nresponsibility of the concerned Insurance Companies to collect/obtain any documentation of the \\ninsured farmers (both loanee and non -loanee) from the bank/f inancial institutions/ intermediaries/ \\nagents if necessary for verification/acceptance of risk and also to facilitate the banks/ financial \\ninstitutions/ intermediaries/ agents to submit/ upload all requisite documents/information on the \\nNational Crop Insur ance Portal within timelines.  \\n17.11   Insurance Companies should also reconcile the details of individual insured farmers uploaded on the \\nPortal with the premium/consolidated declaration received from each branch/nodal bank within the \\nstipulated date and any def iciency/ mismatch may be reported to concerned bank branch/nodal bank. \\nThe Bank Branch/Nodal Bank should further send/upload the requisite info rmation in respect of such \\nfarmers for whom clarification has been sought, immediately within 7 days.  If such re ctification is not \\ndone/completed by bank branch /nodal bank within the stipulated period, Insurance Companies may \\nrecommend to take necessary action to State Govt. under intimation to Central Govt. State Govt. in \\nconsultation with SLBC may recommend suita ble administrative action against such defaulting \\nbranch/bank. However, claims (if any) in such cases of such farmers shall be borne by the concerned \\nbank only.  \\n17.12   Insuran ce Companies should verify and satisfy themselves about the coverage of farmers/ crops and \\ngive acceptance to the applications submitted by banks electronically through National Crop Insurance \\nPortal. The insured farmer’s personal details like AADHAAR numbers, Banking Details, Address, mobile \\nnos. and all such details prohibited under RBI, I RDA or UIDAI  Act. shall not be displayed/disclosed \\npublicly. Insurance Companies will reconcile the details along with farmer’s share of premium receipt \\nbefore approaching the Govt. to release the final instalment of subsidy  (third Instalment)  under the \\nScheme.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  27 17.13   All Insurance Companies will compulsorily verify and take necessary action including \\napproval/rejection of proposal or policy of any farmer through National Crop Insurance Portal within \\nstipulated date.  After stipulated period for reconciliation &  obtaining further clarification from \\nstakeholders, all pending proposals/information of insured/covered farmers uploaded on Crop \\nInsurance Portal will be treated as approved and Insurance Companies will  cease their right for any \\nfurther verification.  How ever, any losses to the Govt. including excess payment of premium subsidy \\ndue to delayed/non - verification of data/information of individual covered/insured farmers on crop \\ninsurance Portal will be  recovered from concerned Insurance Companies only.  \\n17.14   Banks will ensure distribution of Acknowledgement Receipt along with Folio to each insured farmer \\nwithin  7 days from the acceptance of applications by the concerned insurance company. The \\nAcknowledgement Receipt will be generated through National Crop Ins urance Portal itself.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  28 18.   Assessment of Loss / Shortfall in Yield  \\n18.1  Wide Spread Calamities (based on season -end yield):  The Scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area \\n Approach’ i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities and insurance unit is \\n Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be \\n the same unit or a unit of size higher than Village/  Village Panchayat level, to be decided by the State/ \\n UT Govt.. State Govt. Department overseeing conduct of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut -off date \\n decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs (conducted through smart phone using CCE  \\n Agri App) on National Crop Insurance Portal. Yield data so arrived at will be approved/  uploaded by \\n the concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.  \\n18.2  CCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance  for notified crops*,on a sliding scale, as \\n indicated in Table 4 below:  \\nSl. \\nNo. Level  Minimum sample size  \\n1 District  24 \\n2 Taluka/Tehsil/Block  16 \\n3 Mandal/ Firka /Revenue Circle/Hobli or any other equivalent unit  10 \\n4 Village/Village Panchayat  4 \\n  * Minor crops may be notified at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level.  \\n18.3  In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the \\n modalities mentioned below will be followed:  \\n18.3.1  To bring better transparency and confidence in the data, States shall mandatorily ensure 100% CCEs \\nthrough a mobile application specially designed by Govt. of India for this purpose. No other application \\nshall be used for  conducting CCEs. CCE plots for conducting CCEs shall be chosen through random \\nselection or preferably using RST and secrecy of the selected plot should be maintained until the CCE \\nis actually conducted in order to rule out moral hazards.  \\n18.3.2   In order to prov ide proper benefits to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss \\nexperience, crop should be notified at lowest level i.e.  Village/Village Panchayat  \\n18.3.3   State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balance s. Digitizing \\nthe CCE process including geo -coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ \\ntime - stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs( para \\n20.4)  \\n18.3.4   Wherever external agencies are  proposed to be used by the State Govts. for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs \\nare out -sourced), it should be given only to the registered ‘professional/accredited’ agencies with \\nadequate experience in agricultural field activities/yield estimation. It is mandato ry for these agencies \\nto follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may \\nalso be utilized for assessment of Post -harvest loss and losses due to localized risks.  \\n18.3.5   States shall maintain same procedure and methodology for conducting CCEs as adopted by NSSO or  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  29 State Manual for Crop Production estimation  \\n18.3.6   District level Steering Committee : State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in \\neach district t o plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of \\nyield data to the State Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by District level \\nHead of Department/Organisation responsible for conducting CCE s. Distr ict Agriculture/Cooperative \\nofficers, representatives of SSO and Insurance Companies shall be members. The Steering committee \\nwill compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies so that they shall be well \\ninformed about each and every ac tivity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning, \\nschedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and \\nindividual CCE result etc. Head of Steering Committee wil be responsible for uploading of all requisite \\ninformation on National Crop Insurance Portal i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and \\nimparting training to field functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will \\ncompulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State. \\nConcerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of \\nhead of Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and \\nobtainin g the information of CCEs etc. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics \\nat the office for the insurance company official.  \\n18.3.7   In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non -availability of \\nadequate cropp ed area, adverse weather conditions/inadequate infrastructure etc. the yield estimate \\nfor such IUs can be generated by using methods such as (i) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, \\nor (ii) adopting the yield of a neighbouring IU with maximum corre lation. Priority of applicability of \\naforesaid two methods should be notified by the concerned States in the notification itself, failing \\nwhich option of yield estimate of next higher unit only would be considered. However, this clause shall \\nonly be applic able in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units \\nand cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs.  Special efforts should be made by the State to \\nconduct adequate no. CCEs in all notified units in order to provide appr opriate benefits to farmers.  \\n18.3.8   In case of multi -picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) & \\nother crops of similar nature,  following procedure shall be followed.  \\n18.3.8.1   State needs to, in the beginning;  specify the number of required picking for each crop both for \\nirrigated and un -irrigated conditions. Ideally it should be as per NSSO/IASRI defined guidelines, if it is \\nnot available , State in consultation with local Agriculture Universities  and concerned  ICAR cent er may \\nidentify the required number of pickings. However number of actual picking depends on climatic \\nconditions etc. Hence possibility of further pickings  of each picking  should compulsorily be recorded in \\nCCE app and no. of actual picking will be final in such cases . \\n18.3.8.2  If the required number of CCEs have been done and the required number of picking have not being \\ndone , then for those experiments , factors need to be used to extrapolate yield to the final yield.  \\n18.3.8.3  The factors (proportion of picking wise yield) need to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with \\nthe required number of pickings) from the same  Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un -irrigated \\ncondition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.    \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  30 An Ex ample for Yield Calculation  for multi- picking crop  is mentioned in Table 5 below:  \\nCrop  Experiment no.

Accordingly the picking dates and number will \\nbe adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in \\nDecember and one experiment has shown first picking i n December it will be considered as second \\npicking.  \\n18.3.8.5  If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the  Taluka level even, it should be \\nconsidered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard \\nOperating  Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and \\nweather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having \\nfurther pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile  application/ CCE -Agri App while \\nconducting t he current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for \\ncalculation of AY.   \\nThe Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through onlin e \\nCCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified \\nand approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were \\nconducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual  Yield data, along with the location \\ninformation shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on \\nthe Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed \\n5% of total CCEs . Actual Yield data through any other mo de other than through National Crop  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  31 Insurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within \\npre-defined cut -off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned I nsurance Company , \\nmay inform State Govt . /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action.  \\n18.3.8.6  Insurance Company should be given complete access to co -witness the CCEs, the digital images of the \\nCCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time \\nbasis ( Para  35.2.11 ). A schedule  should be formally given/  shared with Insurance Companies \\nsufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize \\ntheir man power accordingly.   For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one \\nrepresentative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper \\nday to day liaison ( Para  18.3.6).  State shall provide necessary space  in the concerned office & facilitate \\nsharing of information . \\n19.  Dispute resolution regarding Yield Data/Crop loss  \\n19.1  It has been seen, during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, there are various types of yield \\ndisputes, which unnecessarily delays the  claim settlement. Following figure shows the procedures to \\nbe adopted in various cases . \\n Figure. Procedures to be followed in different yield dispute cases  \\n \\n19.2  Wherever  the yield estima tes re ported at IU le vel are ab normally low or high vis -à-vis the general crop \\ncondition the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of various products \\n(e.g. Satellite based Vegetation In dex, Weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including \\nstatistical test, crop models etc.) to confirm  yield estimates. If Insurance Company witnesses any \\nanomaly/deficiency in the actual yield data(partial /consolidated) received from the State Govt., the \\n \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  32 same shall be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of \\nreceip t of yield data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and \\nanomaly, if any, may be resolved  in next 7 days by the  State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC)  \\nheaded by Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department. This \\ncommittee shall be authorized to decide all such cases and the decision in such cases shall be final. The \\nSLCC may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC)  for dispute resolution \\n(Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5 ). In case the matter stands unresolved even after \\nexamination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes \\nof meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and SLCC . Reference to TAC can be made \\nthereafter only in conditions specified in P ara 19.7.1 However, data with anomalies which is not \\nreported within 7  days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines \\ndefined above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State \\ndepartment in batches, i.e. Crop -wise -District -wise lots of data and tim elines for each batch of data \\nshall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of yield data will attract \\npenal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the SLCC  in the matter.  \\n19.3  The existing Technical Advis ory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of \\nEconomics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI,  will be further augmented and  constituted \\nunder the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW and additional  members depending on \\ncase to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian \\nCouncil of Agriculture Research (ICAR),  Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote \\nSensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centr e (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO), \\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), \\nNational Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD)  \\nor any other su ch organisation.  \\n19.4  The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case, \\nthe matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency (as \\ndefined in the SOP for yield dis pute). Technical Agency (TA)  will compulsorily take \\ninput/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and \\nmay also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of \\nchairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP.  \\n19.5  State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to \\nresolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary  of the concerned \\ndepar tment with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state \\ncentre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the \\nconcerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for \\nfurther deliberation/examination and decision.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  33 19.6  TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions \\nbased on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and t echnical parameters as \\ndetailed in the SOP.  \\n19.7  The SOP to deal with yield dispute cases  is as under:  \\n19.7.1  When to use this SOP : This SOP will be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield \\nvalues between the State Government and the Insurance Company and this has not been resolved at \\nSLCC level and STAC ( Para 19.2) and the matter has been referred to the Central Gove rnment \\nTechnical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a \\nTechnical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following \\nconditions are satisfied.   All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their \\ndecision shall be final and binding on all concerned.  \\n• There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the \\ninsurance company.  \\n• There is sufficient document ary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required \\nnumber and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the IUs for the particular crop \\nin the Cluster.  \\n• The matter has  been considered by the SLCC  and STAC  but could not be resolv ed at State level.  \\n• The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State \\nGovt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to \\nsupport its claim.  \\n \\n19.7.2  The Organizat ions to which TAC can refer the  case  to: The organizations can be Central Govt.  or \\nautonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity  to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC \\n(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non -government organizations (e.g. \\nCCAFS -BISA- CGIAR), as decided by TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical \\nAgencies.  \\n \\n19.7.3  Data to be provided by State Government :  \\n• All CCEs data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs \\nand other collateral data, as collected during CCE. The CCE data should be ideally geo referenced.  \\n• Village level crop area estimates.  \\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at  Taluka/block \\nlevel) in digital format, (preferably Excel)  \\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if no t \\navailable, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, \\nrainy days and temperature, in digital format, (preferably Excel)  \\n• Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rain fall or any \\nother natural/ manmade disasters in that area  \\n• Report of any analysis carried out by the States to support its claim   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  34  \\n19.7.4  Data to be provided by Insurance Company:  \\n• Data of the co -observed CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital form at, (preferably \\nExcel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during CCE  \\n• Data of weather observatories*, if maintained or sourced  by Insurance Companies, in the contested \\narea  \\n• Report of the technical studies* carried out by the Ins urance Company to support its claim.  \\n• Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested.  \\n• Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area  \\n (*This data shall only be considered where prior approval for such agency has been taken from State \\nGovt . as outlined in para 2.13 ) \\n  \\n19.7.5  Analysis to be carried out by the Technical Agency :  \\n Among the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed from a to d and an y one step should be \\nfollowed from e to f. The steps in g and h are compulsory.  \\n• Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data : Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range, \\nStandard Error, etc.)  Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro -Wilk test, Quartile-  Quartile plot, \\nWhiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It  also needs to be checked whether CCEs were \\ndone using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify \\nreasons for lower number of CCE.  \\n• Analysis of Weather Data : Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at  grid level using \\ngridded or satellite based data, Dry -spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis \\n(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop \\ncondition), either from ground or satelli te data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be \\nstudied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall \\ndata or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground \\nstations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree \\ndata should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather \\ndata can also be sourced from weather companies.  \\n• Analysis of  Long -term Yield Data : Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or  Taluka level) analysis \\nshould be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean \\nyield, standard deviation, and CV.  \\n• Analysis of Other collateral data : Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop \\nWeather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme  crop reports, drought \\nassessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2 -3 years \\n(http://agmarknet.gov.in/ ), crop condition data available on VEDAS platform \\n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/ ), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather \\nbulletins, weather info rmation/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/ ),   \\netc. \\n• Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this \\npurpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  35 (NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health \\nIndex (VHI), Enh ance Vegetation Index (EVI),  etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of \\nappropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).  \\n  Table 6  : Types  of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of \\nanalysis  \\nLevel of \\nAnalysis  Spatial \\nResolution  \\nto be used Examples of Satellite/Sensor  \\nVillage level  5-10 m or \\nbetter  Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid  Eye (6.5 \\nm); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m)  \\nBlock/Tehsil \\nlevel  10-30 m  Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI \\n(10 m)  \\nDistrict level  50-100 m  Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m)  \\n However, wherever long -term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should \\nnot be used for village level for information.  Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop \\nmaps should be overlaid on the data.  Generally f or few major crops, crop maps are prepared under \\nFASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote \\nsensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution.  Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least \\nagricultural area m ap should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest \\n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.   \\n• Crop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such a s \\nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi -physical modelling approach can also be used \\nfor crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated \\nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolutio n, at least 5 km.  \\n• Identification of Outliers : All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any \\nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. \\nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remo te sensing vegetation indices (single or \\ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, \\nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.  \\nWhatever, yield proxi es to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record \\ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the \\nparticular crop’s yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield pro xy map. Both \\nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4 -5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, \\nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 \\nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be conside red, as outliers.  \\n• Computing Yield for the Outliers : For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield \\nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long -term \\nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote \\nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  36 The final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The \\nweightage to be g iven to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or \\nModel). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo \\nlocation, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estim ates, if \\nmodel is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant \\nthe average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may \\nhave specific and special cause related to a p roblem and may not be considered as a reference for \\nany other case.)  Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm \\nrainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post -harvest stage has different impacts; a small \\namount rainfall having devastating wind -speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall \\nhaving calm or no -wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to \\nconsider each of the cases as an individual and special case.  \\n \\n19.7.6  Time required for the analysis : The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical \\nagency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State \\nGovernment.  \\n \\n19.7.7  Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its \\nexisting resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may \\nbe funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever orga nization has \\nbrought the dispute issue up to TAC.  \\n \\n19.7.8  General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long \\nrun, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions  are made \\nto avoid dispute.  \\n• The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and \\ncollect the data using Smartphone based Android App  \\n• States need to pro -actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimatio n \\n• States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State \\nlevel organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres \\nlocated in the State, local IMD office, etc.  \\n• The Insuran ce Companies  should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs.  \\n• The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss \\nassessment.  \\n• There should be better coordination between the State and the In surance Companies.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  37 20.  Use   of   Innovative Technologies  \\n20.1  To Rationalize CCEs:  With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging \\ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.  \\nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference \\nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the \\ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health . This feature can be successfully used to target \\nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’ \\n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number  of CCEs, to make them \\nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce  the total need of CCEs by about \\n30-40%  while maintaining similar accuracy . It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it \\nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU an d not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this \\ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in \\ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For  \\nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under \\nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, \\npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to \\nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized \\ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be \\nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop \\nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a \\nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This  can be done in consultation \\nwith MNCFC, NRSC  (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department  has also been piloting such \\nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.  \\n20.2  To remove Area Discrepancy in c overage:  It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, \\narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, \\ndigitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this d etailed \\nprocedure has been laid down in section  25  \\n20.3  For Direct Yield Estimation  \\n20.3.1   For addressing the issue of r eliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy , representativeness and \\ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as  satellite remote sensing , drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real \\ntime transmission of data etc. should  be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and \\ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international \\norganizations, including MNC FC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the \\nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various \\nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and \\nsupport timely claim processing and payments.  \\n20.3.2   States, with the support of nation al centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out \\nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mention ed  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  38 above, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant  correlation is observed between \\nremote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance \\nCompanies can use these technologies in estimating the cro p yields at IU level, subject to the \\nsatisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to \\nservice the claims.  \\n20.4  To improve Yield -data Quality and Timeliness  \\n \\n20.4.1   It has been observed that the normall  CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is \\nlacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real \\ntime, good quality and reliable  actual yield -data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held \\ndevices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri -app. RST using satellite and drones , weather data, \\nmodel  etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation \\nthrough CCEs.  \\n20.4.2   The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand \\nheld devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and S tate \\nGovts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by \\nCentral Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones \\nand other related costs  (RST, Drone, etc).  \\n20.5  Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for \\nmeeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt. \\nfunds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with exc ess farmers share of premium surrendered \\nby Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on \\naccount of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2  \\n21.  Assessment of Claims  \\n21.1  Wide Spread Calamities  \\n21.1.1   If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite \\nnumber of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers \\ngrowing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in \\nyield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.  \\n ‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:  \\n       (Threshold Yield – Actual Yield)  \\n                             ———————————————        X     Sum Insured  \\n                                                          Threshold Yield  \\n Where Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years \\nfrom pas t seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop  \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  39 21.1.2   Illustration  \\n In table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of “X”. \\nCalculation of TY for Rabi 2014 -15 season is given in Table 7 below : \\nYear  2008 -09 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 2014 -15 \\nYield(kg/ha)  4500  3750  2000  4250  1800  4300  1750  \\n The years of 2012 -13 and 2014 -15 have the lowest yields.  \\n Total of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is  3550kg/ha \\ni.e.(1800+1750).  Therefore according to the provision, average of best five years excluding two lowest \\nyield years will be (22350 –3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% \\nof indemnity levels will be  3384kg/ha, 3008kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively.  \\n21.2  On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid- Season Adversity  \\n21.2.1   Insurance cover will be provided to the farmers to provide immediate relief in case of adverse \\nseasonal conditions during the crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc., \\nwherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Normal  Yield.  \\n21.2.2   Eligibility Criteria : \\n21.2.2.1  All notified IUs would be eligible for “ON ACCOUNT” payment only if the expected Yield of the affected \\ncrop during the season is less than 50% of  Normal Yield . \\n21.2.2.2  The provision could be invoked for a specific crop or group of crops in notified IU, by the State Govt. \\nthrough damage notification based on the proxy indicators and depending on fulfilment of laid down \\nconditions  \\n21.2.2.3  The quantum of likely losses and the amount of ‘on -account’ payment  shall be decided  based on the \\njoint survey by Insurance Company and State Govt. officials.  \\n21.2.2.4  Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the \\npremium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the \\nState Govt. for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks mu st ensure to debit farmers premium \\nwithin 15 days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan to provide benefit of this add on products , \\nfailing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible famers.  \\n21.2.2.5   Amount payable would be 2 5% of the likely claims, subject to adjustment against final claims.  \\n21.2.2.6  If adversity occurs within 15 days before the normal harvest time, this provision will not be invoked.  \\nThen the losses will not qualify under this provision.  \\n21.2.3   Proxy -Indicators : Indicator s to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather data, \\nsatellite imagery, drought assessment reports of MNCFC and crop condition reports by district level/ \\nState Govt. officials, supported by media report and field photographs. The St ate’s notification should \\nalso spell out all the necessary details in this regard.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  40 21.2.4   Loss assessment procedure : \\n21.2.4.1  Joint Committee of State Govt. and the Insurer for assessment of crop damage have  to be formed and \\nnotified before start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district.  \\n21.2.4.2  This Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for On -Account payment based on the weather data \\n(available AWS notified by the Govt.)/long term average rainfall data/satellite imagery supported by \\nestimated yield losses at n otified IU level. Loss intimation order has to be issued within 7days from the \\nadverse seasonal event.  \\n21.2.4.3  Based on the above report, a joint inspection of the affected area maybe done by Insurance Company \\nalong with State Govt officials for ground truthing us ing mobile phone App  and arrive at the extent of \\nloss.  \\n21.2.4.4  Information/ Services of MNCFC, ISRO or SRSC  may also be utilized for determination of extent of loss , \\nusing satellite data,   for On Account payout.  \\n21.2.4.5  If the expected loss of the affected crop is more th an 50% of the normal yield for the Notified \\nInsurance Unit, On -Account payment would be payable.  \\n21.2.4.6  On-Account payment would be calculated as per following formula:  \\n \\n             (Threshold Yield -Estimated Yield)  \\n  ———————————————— × Sum Insured ×25%  \\n                                               Threshold Yield  \\n21.2.5   Timeframe for loss assessment and submission of report:  \\n21.2.5.1  An order will be issued by Nodal Dept. of State  Govt. defining eligibility of On Account  payment with \\ndetails of  affected IUs within 7  days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal  event.  \\n21.2.5.2  Loss assessment report at the affected insurance unit level has to be completed by the Joint \\nCommittee within 15 days from occurrence of the adverse seasonal event.  \\n21.2.6   Conditions:  \\n21.2.6.1  Mere disbursement/ sanct ion of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notification of \\ncalamity would not make a farmer eligible for the claim.  \\n21.2.6.2  The On -Account payment would be disbursed by the Insurance Company without waiting for the \\nreceipt of final share of Govt. sub sidy (Second Instalment)  \\n21.2.6.3  On Account payment would be paid to all eligible insured farmers within one month of the notification \\ninvoking this provision by the State Govt. and subject to receipt of loss assessment report from State \\nGovt..  \\n21.2.6.4  These claims would be adjusted against the end season area approach yield based claims.  \\n21.2.6.5  Bank would remit farmers’  premium to Insurance Company, with farmers list, within 7 days of  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  41 intimation of loss under this section, if not uploaded earlier on Portal. However, this option must be \\nexercised as a last recourse with proper justification.   \\n21.2.7  Illustration  \\n21.2.7.1  District ‘A’ has been affected by floods having 100 insurance units under Crop ‘X’. Out of which 50 \\ninsurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro -met data, it has been \\nassessed that 30 IUs could ha ve yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield . Out of these 30 \\ninsurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category -I), for another 10 units, it is 70% \\n(Category -II) and remaining 1 5units, it is 60% (Category -III) of normal average yield. As per declarations \\nreceived, if sum insured for notified areas in Category -I, Category -II and Category -III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 \\ncrore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will b e Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, \\nrespectively.

Procedure for Settlement of Claims to the farmers  \\n23.1   Tentative final share of Govt. subsidy (2nd instalment) , both Central and State, on the basis of business \\nstatistics finalized on portal after 30 days of period specified for auto approval of applications on portal \\nshould have been received by Insurance Company to enable them to settle the Actual Yield based \\nclaims arising out of wide -spread calamity as well as for claims against post harvest losses. However, \\nfor settlement of On -Account payment of claims, prevented sowing/planting/germination claims and \\nLocalized calamity claims, advance subsidy  (1st instalment)  of  50% of 80% of respe ctive Central/State \\nGovt. share in corresponding previous season should have been received for the season/area(s)  \\n23.2  Threshold Yield for all notified crops at each IU level shall compulso rily be part of the notification for \\nthe season and shall not change at any point during that season. Crop -IU wise historical Average Yield, \\nCalamity Years, Indemnity level and Threshold Yield shall be uploaded on the Portal by the concerned \\nState Nodal Depart ment at the time of release of notification only and shall be verified and accepted \\nby the concerned Insurance Company within given timelines. In order to avoid manipulation/misuse of \\ninformation at field level, threshold Yield shall not be a part of publi c information before payment of \\nclaims for that season.  \\n23.3  The DLMC will be required to upload/enter the details of crop loss as per the Joint Loss Survey \\nconducted by DLJC for all intermediate loss events viz. prevented sowing/planting/germination failure \\n&Mid -season Adversity on the National Crop Insurance Portal. Similarly, the crop loss details for \\nlocalized losses and post -harvest loss events shall be entered by the concerned Insurance Company on \\nthe Portal. Once the Actual Yield data is available on th e Portal, the same shall be verified and \\napproved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were conducted \\noffline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data shall be uploaded by the concerned District \\nadministration or State nodal department on the Portal itself.  \\n23.4  The loss reports and Actual Yield data shall be approved/ reverted ( in case of any discrepancy/concern \\non the authenticity/correctness of report/data) by the Insurance Company based on which the eligible \\nclaims shall be calculated through the Portal and accordingly the payment of claims shall be initiated \\nby the concerned Insurance Company and remitted directly into beneficiary account as per pre -\\ndefined timelines. The application wise payment details viz. am ount, reference number, date etc. shall \\nbe entered/  synchronised with the National Crop Insurance Portal for future reference and audit \\npurpose.  \\n23.5  In case of widespread calamity (end of season claims ), once yield data is received/finalized from State \\nGovt. as per the cut -off-dates decided, claims will be worked out on the National Crop Insurance Portal \\nas per declarations/ approved proposals & covered farmer’s data received from banks / channel \\npartners / insurance intermediaries for each notified area and c rops and accordingly the claims will be \\napproved by Competent Authority of implementing Insurance Company.  \\n23.6  In case of farmers covered through Financial Institution, claims shall be released only through \\nelectronic transfer directly into insured farmer’s g iven bank account, followed by details containing \\nclaim particulars, to individual bank branches/ nodal banks; Bank Branch should also display particulars  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  56 of claim disbursal on notice board  to enable spread of awareness and inclination amongst farming \\ncomm unity for risk mitigation through crop insurance. Insurance Company is required to compulsorily \\nupload the claim details against each insured farmer on National crop insurance Portal.  \\n23.7  In case of farmers covered on voluntary basis through intermediaries, p ayable claim s will direc tly be \\ncredite d to the bank accounts of concerned insured farmers and deta ils of th e claims may also be \\nintimated to them. The list of beneficiaries shall also be uploaded on National  Crop Insurance Portal \\nimmed iately.  \\n23.8  In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post - harvest losses; Insurance \\nCompany  will process the claim s after assessment and sh all release th e claims as  per detailed \\nproc edure given in the relevant sections above.  \\n23.9  The claim settlement intimation shall be sent to each beneficiary farmer through SMS from the Portal \\nitself. State Govts, Banks &  Insurance companies shall ensure correctness of data before hand viz. \\nThreshold Yield, Actual Yield, Insured Area, Sum Insured and Indemnity levels  etc. Responsibility of any \\nerror, omissions and mis -reporting shall lie with the concerned State Nodal Department and insurance \\nCompany. State Govt. &  Insurance Companies shall resolve all the gri evances of the insured far mers \\nand other stakeholders in th e shortest possible time.  \\n23.10   In any situation, State Govt. can not reopen/ re calculate claims after 30 days of claims settlement for \\nnotified crop(s) at notified unit . Disputed claims / sub -standard claims , if any, due to erroneous data  \\nmay be referred wi thin this time to SLCC/STAC  and further to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), if \\nrequired, for consideration and decision  \\n24.  Important Conditions /Clauses Applicable for Coverage of Risks  \\n24.1  Insurance companies should have received the premium for c overage either from bank , channe l \\npartner, insuranc e intermediary or directly. In case o f any loss in transit due to negligence by these \\nagencies or non remittance of premium by these agencies, the concerned bank/intermediaries shall be \\nliable for payment of claim s. \\n24.2  In case of any substantial misreporting by nodal bank /branch in c ase of compulsory farmers \\ncoverage, the concerned bank only shall be liable for such mis -reporting.  \\n24.3  Mere sanctioning/ disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals/ declaration s and \\nremittance of premium by farmer/bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, does not constitute \\nacceptance of risk by Insurance Company . \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  57 25.  Acreage discrepancy  \\n25.1  Some  areas  in the past  have  reported  excess  insurance  coverage  vis-à-vis planted  acreage,  leading to over -\\ninsurance.   Ideally  the discrepancy  should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers \\nwith genuine insurance  coverage.  All suitable  measures  are being taken  by concerned stakeholders for \\nde duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and \\nproposal/loan application of insured farmers.  The details of individual insured farmers are being \\ncollected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absen ce of digitized \\nfarm records on a GIS platform  and its integration with the Portal , it would  be cumbersome  to \\nphysically  verify  each  farm  when  the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the \\nsown areas.   Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which \\nis not being included in sowing areas  furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of \\ncrop the during the season . State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in \\nconsul tation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.  \\n25.2  Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of \\nactuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and r esultant \\nclaims on the application of ACF . However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the \\nresponsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the \\ncrop which farmer actually intend to sow /actually s own.  Option to change the insured crop has also \\nbeen provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is \\nalso a provision to indemnify th e crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of \\nindividual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to \\nforfeiting of claims , if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.       \\n25.3  Area Discrepancy will be applied only to  those major crop s for which Normal area sown data at the \\nBlock/Taluka level  shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring \\nthe areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions  and \\nshall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal.  No other data from any source including \\nState Govt. will be considered.  \\n25.4  However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published \\ncultivable area at Taluka level should com pulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW , in writing  \\nafter cut  off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with \\nfacts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government \\nand rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal  \\n25.5  Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all.  \\n25.6  If the difference between insured area and sown area  provided by MNCFC   is >30% at Block/Tehsil / \\nTaluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be \\ntreated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.  \\n25.7 Data on application of ACF shal l be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.    \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  58 25.8  Accordingly excess insured area shall be treated as un -insured and corresponding farmer’s premium \\nwill be forfeited and the same will be surrendered to Technology Fund of GOI  and may be utilized for \\nleveraging technology in PMFBY for improvement of technology/research/Impact assessment etc and \\ntowards assistance to States for cost of incremental CCEs  \\n25.9  Premium subsidy refunded by ICs due to application of ACF shall be refunded to Central/State Govt. in \\nration of 50:50   \\n26.  Publicity and Awareness  \\n26.1  Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible \\nmeans of electronic and print media, farmer’s fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries \\nshall be utilized to create and disse minate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme \\namong the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/ \\nCooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and \\npublicit y on an on -going basis from three months  prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly, \\nInsurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work. \\nAll the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance \\nPortal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc.  \\n26.2  The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity \\nbuilding of the associated agents, banks etc for effective imp lementation of the Scheme and organize \\ntraining workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance \\nCompanies.  \\n26.3  Insurance company should spend 0.5 % of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field \\nlevel and  the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every \\nseason. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall \\ndeposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cu t off date for enrolment.  \\n27.  Service Charges  \\n27.1 To Banks  \\n27.1.1  Bank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the farmer’s share of \\npremium by Insurance Company as generated from the Portal and within the 15 days of finalization of \\nbusiness statistics. Rural agents engaged in providing insurance related services to farmers may be \\npaid appropriate commission as decided by Insurance Company , subject to cap prescribed under IRDAI \\nregulations. If there is delay in payment of service charges by Insurance Company beyond 15 days of \\nfinalization of business statistics, amount needs to be paid with interest @12% p.a.  \\n27.1.2  Even if the farmer’s share of premium is contributed/financed by the concerned State Govt. the \\napplicable service charges shall be paid by the concerned Insurance Company only.  \\n27.1.3  No service charges will be payable to the concerned bank/branch for the applications for which any  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  59 anomaly/deficiency/misrepresentation of details/data is found .  \\n27.2 To CSC & Other Intermediaries:  \\n27.2.1  Common Servic e Centres shall be paid service charges by Insurance Companies, as decided by GOI , per  \\nfarmer application form succes sfully submitted by them. This includes charges for submission  of \\nelectronic data of farmers along with uploading of copy of LPC/Land records/ /contract document or \\nany other document defined by the concerned State Govt. to identify share- cropper/tenant farmer, \\nself declaration of intent to sow the proposed crop or sown crop/sowing certificate as notified by \\nState., Bank Passbook, upto 5 pages and printout of one page of premium acknowledgement receipt.  \\n27.2.2  No service charges will be payable to CSC for the applications for which any anomaly/  deficiency/  \\nmisrepresentation of details/data is found .  \\n28.  Goods & Service Tax (GST)  \\n28.1  Collection of premium under  the Scheme is exempted from applicability of Goods & Service Tax (GST)  \\n \\n29.  Monitoring and Review of the Scheme  \\n29.1  State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) of the concerned State will be  \\nresponsible for monitoring of the Schemes/ programme in its  State. However, a National Level \\nMonitoring Committee (NLMC) und er the chairmanship of Secretary , DAC & FW will monitor the \\nScheme at the national level.  \\n29.2  It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop \\nseason to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers:  \\n29.2.1   The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both \\nloanee and non -loanee) like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number,  Aadhaar number  village, \\ncategories – small and marginal/SC/ST/ women, insured acreage, insured crop(s),  sum insured, \\npremium collected, Govt. subsidy etc and submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration \\nmodule along with  electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cut -\\noff date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to \\nthe concerned Insurance Company  by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of \\nindividual c rop. \\n29.2.2   Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area \\ndata but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall \\nimmediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final \\nreceipt of actual yield data  as detailed in section 25 . \\n29.2.3   Insurance Companies shall calculate crop -wise, IU wise payable claims based on the actual yield data \\nand threshold yield given at the time of tendering. Accordingly the payable claims subject to payment  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  60 of full premium share by the Central and State Govt for the season shall be remitted by the Insurance \\nCompanies directly into benefitted farmer’s accounts electronically, payment details for which shall be \\nupdated on the National Crop Insurance Portal on daily basis.  \\n29.2.4   After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial \\ninstitutions/banks should display the list of the beneficiaries/details of claims (both loanee and non -\\nloanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of \\nfarmers/beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc.  \\n29.2.5   The list of beneficiaries (Bank -wise and insured area- wise) shall also be uploaded/ placed on  the \\nwebsite of the concerned Insurance Companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public \\ngrievance redressal/feed -back etc . State Govts./UT should ensure that crop insurance products \\nprovide comprehensive insurance coverage to the farmers on sound insurance principles and provide \\nthe best value for the premium. State Govt. may also review the progress of Scheme periodically and \\nundertake impact assessment after the completion of each season and send their suggestion/ \\nrecommen dations to this Department for making further improvements in the Scheme.  \\n29.2.6   About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by Regional Offices/Local level Offices of ICs who will \\nsend the feedback to concerned DLMC and State Govt./SLCCCI on Crop Insurance.  \\n29.2.7   At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the IC may be cross verified by the concerned DLMC and \\nthey should send the feed back to State Govt.  \\n29.2.8   1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Office of the IC/Independent Agencies \\nappointed by the Central Govt./NLMC and they should send the necessary feed back to Central \\nGovernment.  \\n30.  Grievance Redressal Mechanism -  \\n30.1 At the initial level, for grievance redressal, each district shall designate district level grievance redressal \\nofficer preferably District Agri Officer  to respond to the grievances of Farmers, Banks, ICs etc. within 7 \\ndays of receipt of grievance. In case of dissatisfaction the matter may be brought before District Level \\nGrievance Redressal Committee ( DGRC)  \\n30.2  District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC): a district level monitoring Committee shall act \\nas a grievance redressal Committee for redressal of grievances of Farmers, Banks, Insurance Company, \\nDistrict Authority/Department. This Committee will be headed by District Magistrate/Collector and \\nrepresentatives of Farmers, LDM/Banks, DDM NABARD, Insurance Company and concerned District \\nAuthority/Department shall be appointed as members. This Committee may also invite subject \\nspecialists/experts from Univ ersity/IMD/commodity Boards/Research Institutions, SRSC etc. if deemed \\nnecessary. The Committee will dispose the matter within 15 days. The decision of the Committee shall \\nbe accepted by all the parties and in case of disagreement with the decision;  the sa me shall be \\nrepresented to the State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) within 15 days from the \\ndecision of DGRC. In case the DGRC doesn’t take the matter for discussion within7 days from  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  61 submission of grievance or the grievance has wider scope of effect impacting more number of districts \\nor there is a breach of guidelines by any of the stakeholder or the grievance matter exceeds Rs. 25 \\nLakh in monetary terms, the matter may be directly raised at State Level Grievance Redressal \\nCommittee.  \\n30.3  State Lev el Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC):  a State level monitoring Committee shall act as a \\ngrievance redressal Committee for redressal of grievance of Farmers, Banks, Insurance Company, \\nDistrict Authority/Department which does not  get settled at DGRC.

Empanelment and Selection of Insurance Companies  \\n31.1  Empanelment Criteria  \\n31.1.1   The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC \\n& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The \\nInsurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate \\nexperience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC& FW. \\nOnce Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC & FW, it is considered as pre -qualified \\ncompany to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the \\nScheme/Programme of DAC& FW.  \\n31.1.2   L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines \\nafter being declared L1,  it will be de -empanelled/ de -barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for \\nthe coming/next season(s) in the concerned Stat e and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing \\nthe crop insurance Scheme at L1 district -crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their \\nconsent . All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for \\nwithdrawal /surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further \\ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to \\nthe State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selec ted bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing \\nL1 bidder.  \\n31.1.3   Tender should be  preferably for 3 years and in no case less than  1 year  \\n31.1.4   Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs  \\n \\n31.2  Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  62 31.2.1   The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as \\nImplementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the \\nScheme in their State. Selection of  IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller \\nStates, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.  \\n31.2.2   Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre -qualified companies \\nas mentioned in the preceding para th rough open tender  for submission of district -wise and crop-\\nwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level, \\nThreshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The  \\nempanell ed companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified \\n/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non -compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.  \\n31.2.3   Based on the district -wise and crop -wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre -qualified \\ncompanies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will \\nbe worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the \\nconcerned cluster.  \\n31.2.4   Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years  as mentioned above Such long \\nterm continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers \\nthrough investment out of the premium savings in variou s welfare activities for socio -economic \\ndevelopment of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthc are/education, \\nfarm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an \\nopportunity t o Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative \\ninteraction and business relationship and service effectiveness.  \\n31.2.5   The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level o f \\ncorresponding previous season.  In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and \\nnecessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if \\nfound at fault may be taken by GOI.   \\n31.2.6   State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more, \\nthreshold yield, crop -wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units, \\ncalamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself \\nbefore floating the formal tender notice.  \\n32.  Clustering / clubbing  of districts for bidding by the State  \\n In order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State \\nGovernment are req uired to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of \\ndistricts/ area with different risk profiles.  Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large \\nState have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon  volume of risk \\nassociated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purp ose of \\nclustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI) \\nbecomes low and risk is shared and diversified. State s may form the clusters of districts based on  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  63 mixed agro -climatic zones.  i) Districts of h igh risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro -\\nclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.  \\n Prior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the \\nInsurance Companies.  \\n The object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives: \\n• Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.  \\n• Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the \\ndiver sification of risk within a clu ster and enable risk spreading for insurer.  \\n• Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro -climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of \\nrisk within a cluster.  \\n• Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored  in \\ncluster formation.  \\n1. Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts.  As per 2016 \\nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 \\nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost \\n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability \\nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower \\nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.  \\n2.  Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for \\nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop \\nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby \\nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived \\nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to \\ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level \\nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO - NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned \\ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in \\nclustering.  \\n3.  These are only for guidance of States  and States are free to follow either of these or any other method \\ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.  \\n4.

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop \\nInsurance Program (www.pmfby.go v.in)  \\n36.1   The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’  viz. farmers, Insurance Companies, \\nfinancial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration, \\ncoordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.  \\n36.2  The idea behind develo ping a web -based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify \\nfragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide \\nfaster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance \\n(www.pmfby.gov.in)  and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for \\ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of \\nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is \\nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby \\nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/lay ered information \\naccess, manual interventions, multi -step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective \\ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and \\nyield/weather data providers with N ational Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching \\nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst \\nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the \\nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it \\nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is \\navailable in two languages  – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.  \\n36.3  The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate \\nadministrative functions. A web -based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a \\nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically -weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance \\nservices.  \\n36.4  The conceptualisation and development of web -portal has already been completed and launched \\nhowever devel opment and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below \\nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.   \\n36.4.1   Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance \\nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed \\nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay -Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation \\nof funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement.  \\n36.4.2   Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company:  For \\nseamless and real- time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance  Companies will be \\nestablished. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange \\nplatform.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  76 • Farmer’s enrolment and premium remittance,  \\n• Information and reports regarding mid -term/preventive sowing/individual/localized claims and  \\n• AY/TY data for final claim calculation and remittance of claims into farmer’s bank account . \\n \\n36.4.3   Integration of Digital Land Records : Various State Govts. are working on digitization of land records \\nand providing facility to land owners to identify and take records of land parcels owned by them. The \\nsame digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal \\nfollowed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This \\nfacility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is \\nprevalent currently.  \\n36.4.4   Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic \\nWeather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges acro ss the country will be procured from IMD and \\nintegrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real- time monitoring of weather \\nparameters, agro -climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid -term \\nadversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather \\ndata to concerned Ins urance Companies and automated claim  calculation and remittance to \\nbeneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real- time information about crop loss and payable \\nclaims vis -a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy \\ndecisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken.  \\n36.4.5   Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For brin ging efficiency in addressing the grievances \\nof farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations \\nand resolution will be integrated with the Portal.   \\n36.4.6   Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web- Portal:  A quick response system is very \\ncrucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders. \\nKeeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all \\nthe stak eholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination.  \\n36.4.7   Development of Mobile -App for Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid -Term Loss Assessment and \\nreporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information s haring and reporting of \\nLocalized/Individual, Preventive/Mid -Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss \\nassessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop \\nInsurance Portal which will be  accessed by all the stakeholders. This will help in monitoring  and faster \\nanalysis and claim settlement.  \\n36.4.8   Integration of Interest Subvention Scheme with Crop Insurance: A web -portal for Interest Subvention \\nScheme is also being developed for monitoring and implementation of ISS. This Portal will be inter-\\nlinked with the National Crop Insurance Portal for automatic enrolment of eligible farmers and \\ndeduction of applicable premium. This will also enable de -duplication of KCC/seasonal Crop Loans and \\nprovisioning of services  \\n36.4.9   Integration of RST/Satellite Data for handling Data Discrepancy/dispute resolution: New Age \\nTechnologies like Remote Sensing Technology is a promising st ep in bringing in procedures and  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  77 systems of approach which is more reliable, accurate and fast in resolving errors/concerns of \\nstakeholders and provide a progressive and scientific solution which the traditional/existing \\nprocedures and practices are unable  to provide. This will help in reduction in time required for \\ncollection and collation of different data sets and reports pertaining to crop health, productivity, \\nsowing and harvesting activities.  \\n36.4.10   MNCFC data Integration on Portal: To streamline the flow o f information amongst stakeholders, the \\nportal will also be integrated with the system/data being developed by MNCFC on aforesaid aspects.  \\n36.4.11  Evaluation & Management Information System (E &MIS) for all stakeholders with secured \\ncredential: For monitoring prog ress of the Scheme, a stakeholder specific customized MIS is also being \\ndeveloped, which will help in monitoring, application creation, notification status, CCE status etc. to \\ngive a summarised overview of different stages of the Scheme.  \\n36.4.12  Data repository fo r risk classification and risk mitigation:  For the purpose of risk estimation, a \\nrepository is being created which will contain IU wise average yield of insured crops for past decade \\nand weather data at the level of automatic weather station to analyse cro p wise risk calculation before \\nseason starts. This repository will be updated regularly for yield data and weather data.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  78 ANNEXURE-  1 \\nIllustration for classification of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and determination of L1 bidder  \\nMethod 1  \\nDefine Risk Level  \\ni.

On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last \\n10 years, districts may be divided in to three catego ries of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture. \\nIf variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus \\nminus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus \\nminus 16 -30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks \\ndistricts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as \\nlow/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of \\ndistricts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be \\ndivided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State. Then, equal no. of low risk districts shall be \\nselected randomly for each cluster of districts.

Objective of the Scheme  \\n Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture \\nsector by way of  \\n• Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events  \\n• Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming  \\n• Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices  \\n• Ensuring flow of c redit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop \\ndiversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides p rotecting \\nfarmers from production risks.  \\n2.  Adoption of Technology for Scheme  Administration : \\n2.1  In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of \\n India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal  (NCIP) ( www.  pmfby.gov.in ). This \\n will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz.  Farmers, States, \\n Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.  \\n2.2  The successful  running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who \\n will have the  responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code \\n mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login c redential module.  \\n2.3  Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and \\n upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum \\ninsured, Govt. subsidy , and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance \\nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc.,  well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate \\nfarmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. Sta te \\nGovt. and concerned Insurance  Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions \\netc. \\n2.4  Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender \\ndocuments which will be followed by entry of bid ded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance \\nCompany immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.  \\n2.5  Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and \\nseamless flow of data/information/reports  on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to \\ncreate/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.  \\n2.6  All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the \\n Portal for administration of the Scheme. De tails of operationalization of modules for each \\n stakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  2 2.7  Secured credential/login, preferably linked with Aadhaar Number and mobile OTP based, for all \\n Stakeholders viz, Central Governmen t, State Governments, Banks, empanelled Insurance Companies \\n and their designated field functionaries will be provided on the Portal to enable them to \\n enter/upload/download the requisite information.  \\n2.8  Insurance Companies shall not distribute/collect/allo w any other proforma/utility/web Portal etc for \\n collecting details of insured farmers separately. However they may provide all requisite support to \\n facilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer’s  details on the Portal well within the \\n prescribed  cut-off dates.  \\n2.9  Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for \\n Insurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released \\n accordingly.  \\n2.10  All data pertaining to crop -wise, area- wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area , coverage \\n and claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop \\n Insurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim c alculation etc.  \\n2.11  Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s \\n data electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to \\n undertake CBS integration in a t ime bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.  \\n2.12   It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention \\n Scheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real tim e \\n sharing of information and better program monitoring.  \\n2.13  Insurance Companies  shall compulsorily use technology/ mobile  applications for monitoring of crop \\n health/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also \\n facilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones  by way of prior approval of \\n agency from which such data can be sourced. This is  required for better monitoring and ground -\\n truthing.   ICs can be active partners  in facilitating use of technology.  \\n2.14  States shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such \\n as crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other \\n related technology for CCE planning, yield  estimation, loss assessment, assessment  of prevented \\n sowing and clustering of districts.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  3 3.  Coverage of Farmers  \\n3.1  All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas \\n are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured \\n crops. The non -loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land \\n records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/ \\n or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State \\n Govt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective \\n States in the notification itself.  \\n3.1.1  Compulsory Component  \\n3.1.1.1  All farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial \\nInstitutions  (FIs) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily. \\nThis provision sha ll override any decision taken by FIs including PACS exempting farmers from \\ncompulsory coverage of loanee farmers.  \\n3.1.1.2  However non -standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned \\nBanks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered c ompulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate  such   \\nfarmers for enrolment as non -loanee farmers .  \\n3.1.1.3  Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/ jewel  \\nloans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and \\nnotified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme.  \\n3.1.2  Voluntary Component  \\n• The Scheme is optional for non -loanee farmers.  \\n• The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt. \\nnotification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.   \\n3.1.3  Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage  of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the \\n Scheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved  in extension and awareness \\n creation amongst farmers and obtaining feed -back of farmers about the implementation of the \\n Scheme  \\n3.1.4  The implementing Insur ance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary \\nmeasures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non -loanee farmers. However \\nother empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen fo r \\nenrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non -loanee farmers at L1 \\npremium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days \\nof finalisation of tender/ issuance  of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the \\nInsurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in \\nthe given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be \\ntaken up on a pilot basis in D istricts notified by State Govt.  They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  4 conditions laid down in Para 17.5 .  \\n3.1.5  These Insurance Company will maintain separate data of such non loanee farmers covered by them \\nand enter the said d ata on the portal as per seasonality discipline detailed in Para 16.2. They shall be \\nliable for payment of claims to such farmers.  \\n3.1.6  The exchan ge of information, co -witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by \\nGovernment/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to \\naccept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non -loanee \\nenrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency.  \\n4.  Coverage of C rops  \\nI. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses),  \\nII. Oilseeds  \\nIII. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.  \\n In addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops \\nfor which standard methodology for yield estimation is available.  \\n5.  Coverage of Risks and Exclusions  \\n5.1  Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new \\n risks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted.  \\n5.1.1  Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/ \\n planting/germination  due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions.  \\n5.1.2  Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is prov ided to cover yield losses \\n due to non -preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease \\n attack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone.  \\n5.1.3  Post -Harvest Losses:  Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting, \\n for those crops which are  required  to be dried  in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field \\n after harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone , Cyclo nic rains and Unseasonal rains.  \\n5.1.4  Localized  Calamities:  Loss/damage  to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified \\n localized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and N atural fire due to lightening \\n affecting isolated farms in the notified area.  \\n5.1.5  Add- on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing  \\n add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be \\n substantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be \\n issued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry  of Environment and Forest and GIC Re.  The  \\n add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable  notiona l premium  will be borne  by the  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  5  farmer,  however  the State Govts  may  consider  providing  additional  subsidy  on this coverage,  \\n wherever  notified.  The  actuarial premium  rates  for add-on coverage  should  be sought  in the bid \\n itself from  the  Insurance  Companies,  however  the  add-on actuarial premium   rate will be \\n considered separately  and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.     \\n5.1.6  General Exclusions:  Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other \\n preventable risk s shall be excluded.  \\n5.1.7  State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above \\n which is  not prevailing in their State/UT  \\n5.1.8  Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of \\n individual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies \\n is essential. For remaining risks losses are due t o wide spread calamit ies. Hence lodging of \\n information for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is  \\n not essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield \\n submitted by concerned Stat e Govt.  \\n6.  Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme  \\n6.1  States:  \\n  Issuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply \\n their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions \\n relating to PMFBY which are binding on States/ UTs are as follows:  \\n6.1.1  Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct \\n of CCEs through CCE -Agri App  and use of  NCIP platform for  flow of information and auto \\n administration of the scheme   \\n6.1.2  State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified \\n insurance unit area;  \\n6.1.3  CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance \\n Company within the notified cut off date ;  \\n6.1.4  State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision  for  premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at \\n the beginning of the crop season;  \\n6.1.5  To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology.  \\n6.1.6  Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National \\n Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated \\n as Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop \\n Insurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAI S and NCIP* may be authorized to \\n oversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  6  constitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present \\n composition of SLCCCI  may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture \\n Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’ \\n Representatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI \\n may  co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.  \\n6.2  Insurance Company:  \\n  Empanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme \\n (PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The \\n empanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for \\n implementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified maj or activities:  \\n6.2.1  To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in  a \\n transparent manner,  \\n6.2.2  Deployment of requisite  infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,  \\n6.2.3  Commitment for  at least 10  % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,  \\n6.2.4  Deployment of sufficient manpower to co -observe CCEs and allied activities  and compulsory use of \\n CCE Co -observation app ,  \\n6.2.5  Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and \\n capacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be \\n submitted to Cent ral and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season.  \\n6.3  Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:  \\n6.3.1  Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards. \\n Therefore, all banks are  advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same \\n applies for non -loanee farmers enrolled through banks/Insuran ce companies/insurance \\n intermediaries.  \\n6.3.2  Farmers not having A adhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for \\n Aadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February, \\n 2017 issued by GOI under Se ction 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other \\n Subsidies, Benefits and Services).  Copy  of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in . This \\n may be  subject to further directions issued  by Govt. from time to time.  \\n6.3.3  All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification \\nunder  Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage \\n of loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the \\n concerned bank branch regularly . \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  7 7.  Notification  \\n7.1  Procedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs:  \\n7.1.1  Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous \\n year, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of \\n bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled In surance Companies for selection to implement the \\nScheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT  Govt.  should ensure the issuance of the notification and \\nits circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of \\nthe commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, \\nareas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops, \\nperiod of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection met hodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt. \\nsubsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be \\nissued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year  \\n7.1.2 In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the \\ndetails as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State \\nNotification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tende r document shall \\nbe allowed post tendering.  \\n7.1.3 Bidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at \\nnotified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template \\nand should be made part of the Tender.  \\n7.1.4 Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified \\ncrops in each district during last year/season . However, in absence of insured area of last year/season \\nfor all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of \\nweighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only.  \\n7.1.5 Bidding shall  be done through e -tendering  and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the \\nopening of the Tender.  \\n7.1.6 Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in \\ndistrict(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by \\nbidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on \\npremium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding \\nperiod. However, recourse to this ceiling  provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as \\na general practice. The ceiling  premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial \\npremium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and  name of such crop should be disclosed by State \\nGovt. compulsorily in the tender document.  \\n7.1.7 In such cases where a ceiling  has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step \\nbidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is fo r disclosing the premium rate offered by \\neach participating Insurance Company for such ceiling  crops and must be categorised under “ Ceiling   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  8 Premium Rate” and  2nd  bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all crops included in \\ntender. Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the \\nbidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies \\nhave to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above.  \\n7.1.8 State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each \\nindividual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the \\ncrop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating \\nInsurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by \\nthe State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered \\nfor left o ut/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after \\ndecision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating \\nInsurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed \\ncrop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate” \\nfrom the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all \\ncrops/remaining crops.  \\n7.1.9 States should av oid doing re -tendering as a general practice. Re -tendering may be held only in \\nexceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI  after submission of a request with \\ndetailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the \\nrequest.  \\n7.1.10  States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums, \\nrequisite data  and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster \\ncommunication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also \\nbe uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.  \\n7.1.11   All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself \\n and no n ew condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any \\n Tender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a \\n copy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender   \\n7.1.12   L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1 \\n bidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment  of \\n work to others, due to increase  in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall  be \\n recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.  \\n7.2  Notification of  Crops,  Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)  \\n7.2.1 The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called \\nInsurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT  will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in \\naccordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village \\nPanchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for maj or crops  defined at District / \\nTaluka or equivalent level.  For other crops  it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village  \\nPanchayat. For defining a crop as a major crop for deciding the Insurance Unit level, the sown area of  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  9 that crop should be at least 25% of Gross Cropped Area in a District/  Taluka or equivalent level  \\n7.2.2 For the claims arising out of crop damage due to post -harvest  losses and localized risks, assessment of \\ndamage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in (Section 2 1, para 21.4 and 21.5 \\nrespectively).  \\n7.2.3 SLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based \\non CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 7 years for calculation of threshold yield), cropped \\nacreage an d capacity for estimating yield during proposed s eason, etc. State govt. should endeavour to \\ncover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State. States should ensure that a standard \\nmethodology of yield estimation exists for all the crops proposed to be notified  \\n7.2.4 State Govt./ UT should provide 10 years’ historical yield data in soft format(in E xcel) in English  to \\nInsurance Companies for calculation of threshold yield , premium rates etc. at insurance unit area  \\nand in its absence, data at next  higher unit/nearest neighbouring unit/weighted average of contiguous \\nunits, as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified area of insurance unit \\nmust be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.  \\n7.2.5 In case State Govts /UT proposes to notify irrigated and un -irrigated areas under a crop separately, \\nthey shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un -irrigated crops \\nseparately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made \\navailable separately for both  \\n7.2.6 While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such \\nas in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State N odal Department to use the \\nrelevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while \\nreleasing the Tender Document  and submiss ion of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible \\nclaims. Insurance Compan ies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document. \\nInformation/ data  provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in c ase of any error/ \\nmisreporting/ disparity , State Govt . and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment  of \\nadditional claims arising on account of it, if any.  \\n7.2.7 For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi -year contract), the States, if required, can \\nnotify additional IUs or de -notify  certain IUs  subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already no tified \\nIUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut- off date for debit of \\npremium. If the  deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be \\nworked out either by calculation of weighted avera ge premium rate as prevalent in contiguous \\ndistricts  or  by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will \\nbe determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs.  \\n7.2.8 States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for \\n50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved \\ntechnology  from GOI.  Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement.  The data source for \\ncalculation of admissibility of incremental CCEs will be the National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  10 7.3 Notification of Indemnity Level, Average Yield and Threshold Yield  \\n7.3.1 Three levels of Indemnity, viz.,  70%, 80% and 90%. SLCCCI in consultation  with Insurance Companies \\nshall approve indemni ty levels for notified crops at  district level. Threshold Yield (TY) shall be notified \\nin the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season.\\n The Average Yield of  a notified crop in Insurance Unit (IU) will be average yield of best five years out of \\nlast seven years. The Threshold yield of  the notified crop is equal to Average Yield multiplied by \\nIndemnity level. The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU shall compul sorily be part of the notification \\nfor the season and shall not change at any point during that season.  \\n7.3.2 Calculation and Notification of Threshold Yield: For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average \\nyield of best five out of last seven years shall be considered.  Further Threshold Yield should be defined \\nonly at notified area level and once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be \\nchanged at later stage under any circumstances.  In case of multi -year contract, the Threshold Yield for \\nthe subsequent years shall be revised by adding/considering the yields of immediate previous \\ncorresponding season. The revised TY and Sum Insured (if revised) should be notified accordingly at \\nthe beginning of each crop season in case of multi -year tender.   \\n7.4 Notification of Seasonality discipline:  \\n7.4.1 State Govt./ UT  in accordance  with the broad seasonality defined/prescribed in the Operational \\nGuidelines shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz. \\nsubmission of insurance proposals/application, consolidated de clarations by banks, remittance of \\npremium to Insurance Companies, uploading of individual covered farmer’s data on National Crop \\nInsurance Portal, submission of yield data, claim assessment of losses for(i) standing crop(ii) localized \\ncalamities,(iii) pre vented sowing, iv) post harvest losses, (v) On -Account payment for major calamities, \\netc as per the provisions of the Scheme.  \\n *In exceptional cases, where last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of\\n Bidding/Notification, yield dat a is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However \\n the yield data upto last to last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself. \\n However, in such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the bas is of yield data of last 7 \\n years only.  \\n7.5  Notification of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)  \\n7.5.1  Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which \\nare as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/ any agency  to be \\nnotified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real \\ntime  weather data.  AWS/ARG    of private agencies  should only be considered in absence of properly \\nfunctioning AWS/ARGs of  IMD/  State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be \\ntransferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data \\non the Portal will be circulated separately.  \\n7.5.2  State govt can explore the possibilit y to create dense AWS/ARG network on PPP Mode for wh ich GOI \\nwill provide 50% of the  viability gap funding.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  11  \\n7.5.3  The following data sources may  be used for validation of on account   claims and claims for prevented \\nsowing:  \\n• Satellite/UAV Remote  Sensing Data  \\n• AWS/ARG Data  \\n• MNCFC Report/Study  on drought assessment  \\n7.5.4  State Govt. shall notify concerned weather data provider/ expert agency whose report/ methodology \\n would be used in assessing the extent of losses and computation of claims. Cost of such weather data \\n shall be borne by the concerned Insurance Companies . The notified AWS and ARG should fulfil/ meet \\n the standards/ norms/ criteria specified by the concerned authorities from time to time.  \\n8.  Engagement of Common Service Centres (CSCs) and I ntermediaries \\nfor coverage of Non -Loanee Farmers:  \\n8.1  CSCs u nder Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (M eITY ) have been engaged to enrol \\n non-loanee farmers. The Insurance Companies are required to enter into a separate agreement with \\n CSC and pay service charges  as fixed by DAC&FW, GOI per farmer per village per season. No other \\n agreement or payment is required to be made for this purpose. Nodal agency for engagement with \\n Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Insurance Companies will be CSC -SPV, a com pany \\n established under M eITY for carrying out e -governance initiatives of GoI.  \\n8.2  No charges/f ee shall be borne or paid by the farmers being enrolled through CSCs i.e. CSC -SPV and \\n CSC-VLE \\n8.3  As per IRDA circular, no separate qualification/certification will be required for the VLEs of CSCs to \\n facilitate enrolment of non -loanee farmers.  \\n8.4  All empanelled Insurance Companies will compulsorily be required to enter into an agreement with \\n CSC for enrolment of non -loanee farmers and for provision of other defined s ervices to farmers.  \\n8.5  Other designated intermediaries may be linked with the Portal in due course.  \\n8.6  Empanelled Insurance Companies have to necessarily register on the portal and submit list and details \\n of agents/intermediaries engaged for enrolment of no n-loanee farmers in the beginning of each \\n season  within 10 days of award of work in the State.  Further all agents/intermediaries have to work \\n strictly as per the provisions of the Scheme and IRDA regulations  \\n9.  Electronic Remittance of Funds  \\n9.1  Govt. of India and State Govt. will endeavour to utilize Public Financial Management System \\n (PFMS)/PFMS linked systems to remit the funds to State Govt/agencies  \\n9.2 Banks, CSC and Insurance Agents are required to remit the premium payment to respective Insurance  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  12 Company mandatorily through Payment gateway (Pay -Gov) of National Crop Insurance Portal or \\nthrough RTGS/NEFT followed by mandatory uploading of payment detail s on National Crop Insurance \\nPortal within stipulated date. Bank details of Insurance Companies shall be made available on National \\nCrop Insurance Portal itself. Accordingly, all Stakeholders including Insurance Companies, Bank \\nbranches, CSC and Insurance Agents must compulsorily maintain dedicated bank accounts for this \\npurpose. No remittance/financial transaction in the form of Banker’s cheque/Demand Draft will be \\nallowed.  \\n9.3 Insurance companies will be provided login access to the essential crop notificatio n data/information \\nalong with farmer level coverage data including banking details of individual farmers on the National \\nCrop Insurance Portal to reconcile, verify, validate and calculate payable claims and remit  the same \\ndirectly into pre -declared bank a ccounts linked to the National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n10.  Census Code Mapping of Entities;  \\n10.1  All States shall map census codes of their villages with the higher administrative/revenue units like \\nGram Panchayat, Firkas, Patwar Circles, Revenue Circles, Hoblis, Mandals, Blocks, Tehsils,  Talukas, \\nDistricts and Automatic Weather Stations/Backup Weather Stations. This will create a standard \\nmechanism of mapping and identification across the country.   \\n10.2  Further, for purposes of obtaining accurate location, State Gov ts. must also provide geo coded  \\n(latitude. & longitude) village maps on digital format for integration with other Apps like CCEs Agri \\nApp, Loss reporting/Assessment App etc.  \\n11.  Digitization of Land Records  \\n11.1  State Govts. are advised to digitize their revenue records using village Census codes so that the \\nindividual land records of farmers can be accessed through the National Crop Insurance Portal for crop \\ninsurance. This will help the Govt. to reach and identify individual beneficiaries and bring utmost \\ntrans parency and authenticity in benefit transfer.  \\n12.  Sum Insured /Coverage Limit  \\n12.1  Sum Insured per hectare for both loanee and non -loanee farmers will be same and equal to the Scale \\nof Finance as decided by the DLTC/SLTC, and would be pre -declared by SLCCCI and notified. No other \\ncalculation of Scale of Finance will be applicable. Sum Insured for individual fa rmer is equal to the SOF \\nper hectar e mult iplied by a rea of the notified crop proposed by the farmer for insurance. Area under \\ncultivation shall always be expressed in hectare’.  \\n12.2  In cases where crops are separately notified under irrigated, un -irrigated category by State Govts. Sum \\ninsured for irrigated and un -irrigated areas should be separately  indicated . \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  13 13.  Premium Rates and Premium Subsidy  \\n13.1  The Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) would be charged under PMFBY by implementing Insurance \\n Company. The rate of premium payable by the farmer will be as per the following T able  1: \\nSeason  Crops  Maximum Premium payable by farmer (% of \\nSum Insured)*  \\nKharif  All food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \\nPulses and Oilseeds crops)  2.0% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\nRabi  All food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, \\nPulses and oilseeds)  1.5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less \\nKharif and \\nRabi  Annual Commercial/ Annual Horticultural crops  5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\nPerennial horticultural crops (pilot basis)  5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less  \\n * Premium paid by non loanee farmers should be rounded off in Rupee terms  \\n13.2  Payment of Govt. Subsidy:  \\n13.2.1   The difference between A ctuarial Premium  Rate and the rate of Insurance premium payable by \\n farmers shall be treated as Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally by the \\n Centre and State Govts. However, the State/ UT Govts. are free to extend additional subsidy over and \\n above the normal subsidy from its budget. In other words, additional subsidy, if any shall be borne \\n entirely by the State/ UT Govt.  Subsidy in premium is  allowed only to the extent of Sum Insured . \\n13.2.2   Govt. premium subsidy to the Private empanelled Insurance Companies may be routed  through \\n Agricultural Insurance Company  (AIC) or any agency designated by GOI strictly as per the \\n guidelines/order of the Govt . This may be reviewed later by Central Govt. and changed  according ly if \\n necessary. Accordingly, AIC/ other designated agency is empowered to call/ collect all requisite \\n information related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Govt. funds and to share \\n the same with the Govt for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. The \\n premium subsidy will be routed through PFMS/PFMS linked systems strictly based on the MIS \\n generated through National Crop Insurance Portal.  \\n13.2.3   Govt, both Centre and State,  will  release their share of advance subsidy (First Instalment) equivalent \\n to 50% of 80% of their respective share of subsidy in corresponding previous season subject to \\n fulfilment of General Financial Rule(GFR)/guidelines in the matter without waiting for coverage \\n details  for the ongoing  season.  \\n13.2.4   To facilitate settlement of prevented risk/ mid season adversity/localized claims: ICs should release the \\n admissible claim amount to the beneficiary immediately after receipt of farme rs premium and \\n advance subsidy ( 1st Instalment) and without waiting for release of final subsidy (Second Instalment) \\n from  Govt. The  premium in  respect of affected IUs including subsidy to enable settlement of \\n claims arising due to above events in res pect of all such beneficiaries shall be adjusted from the fund \\n already  available with ICs as advance upfront subsidy (First Instalment) to facilitate compliance of \\n Section 64 B  of Insurance Act/Regulation of IRDAI   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  14 13.2.5   All admissible claims  based on Yield data/Post harvest losses will be settled on  receipt of second \\n installment of Govt. subsidy to be paid on the basis of tentative business statistics generated on the \\n portal after 15 days of period specified for auto approval of application s on the Portal. The remaining \\n Govt. subsidy, if any will be paid after reconciliation of all business statistics for the season on portal.  \\n13.2.6   All empanelled insurance companies including private insurance companies shall provide free access \\n to the Cen tral/State level agencies including CAG authorized to verify the accounts and audit in \\n respect of Crop Insurance.  \\n13.2.7   In case, the State Govt.  subsidizes full farmers’ share of premium, in that case a token amount of at \\n least Re. 1 should compulsorily be charge d from the farmer to facilitate electronic tracking.  \\n13.2.8   State Govt. has to release the State share of premium subsidy within 3 months from premium \\n requisition by concerned Insurance Company failing which 1% interest per month shall be levied as \\n penalty on the State govt.  \\n13.3  Payment of Claim Liabilities:  \\n13.3.1   Insurance company shall take all necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their \\nportfolio in order to safeguard insured’s interest. In case premium to claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or \\npercentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a crop \\nseason, then Govt. will provide protection to Insurance Companies. The losses exceeding the above \\nmentioned level in the crop season would be met from equal contrib ution of the Central Govt. and the \\nconcerned State/UT Govts. In case losses are below the above mentioned condition, insurers shall be \\nresponsible to settle the admissible claims.  \\n14.  Budget for Administrative Expenses  \\n14.1   At least 2% of the total budget for PMFBY shall be earmarked by State/UTs for administrative \\n expenses, publicity, yield/loss assessment expenses, purchase of smart phones, adoption of new \\n technology, setting up of State Technical Support Unit (STSU), tra velling and contingency fund.  \\n14.2  Govt. of India has already made provisions for separate allocations under sub heads like Salaries, \\nDomestic Travel Expenses , Technology interventions, Office Expenses , other Administrative Expenses  \\nand Professional S ervices etc. for Crop Insurance program under PMFBY/RWBCIS.  States should make \\nprovisions and  budget ary allocation on similar lines including subhead for incremental cost of CCEs.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  15 15.  Technical Support Unit (TSU)/ CPMU  \\n15.1  National Technical Support Unit (NTS U) or Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) will be created \\nat the Central level at the earliest to provide support and advise on risk classification & rating, \\ndevelopment of new products, methodology for loss assessment, legal works, workshop/training & \\ncapacity building, alongwith use of technology including innovation/ replication, digitisation of \\nadministration of Schemes through Crop Insurance Portal etc.  \\n15.2  NTSU shall calculate Loss Cost (LC) i.e. Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of \\nnotified crop(s) in notified unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/ \\nRabi) along with approximate actuarial premium rate of the crops proposed to be notified for the \\nseason. This loss cost/premium rate shall be based on the latest available yield data in month of \\nJanuary  for Kharif crops and July  for Rabi crops and shall be provided to DAC & FW/ Concerned States \\non request before invitation for premium bidding. This calculation to be done by NTSU on behalf of \\nDAC & FW  is only for official purposes to have information on the approximate cost to the IA for \\ncovering the risks so as to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.  \\n15.3  National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) may also develop a suitable methodology for risk \\nclassification/premium rating by using historical yield data, weather data, use and level of \\ninputs/irrigation/technology in crop cultivation, remote sensing data/information etc. for \\nstandardization of methodology for risk perception and premium rating fo r crop insurance in the \\ncountry.  \\n15.4  In addition to National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) / Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) \\nat Central level, all States/UTs implementing Schemes should also create a separate TSU/PMU at State \\nHQ level with sufficient technical experts/staff to ensure  proper implementation of the Scheme.  State \\nTSU (STSU) may also opt for members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other \\norganizations/research institutes etc as deemed fit. However, States shall have to allocate a separate \\nbudget for running the STSU.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  16 16.  Seasonality Discipline  \\n16.1  The cut -off date is uniform for both loanee and non -loanee cultivators. The State -wise cut -off dates for \\n different crops shall be based on Crop Calendar of major crops published from time to time by the \\nDirectorate of Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW,GOI. The latest copy of the Crop Calendar (District \\nWise, Crop Wise) is available on www.pmfby.gov.in . The SLCCCI, shall besides considering the \\nprevailing agro -climatic conditions, rainfall distribution/ availability of water for irrigation, sowing \\npattern etc. in consultation with the Insurance Company fix seasonality discipline of the coverage and \\nother activities in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards.

However due care has to be taken that such extension does not lead to moral hazard and \\nmisuse of the Scheme and suitable measures should be put forth for the same accordingly.  \\n16.5  Further, in case of three crop s / season pattern, a modified seasonality discipline keeping in view the \\noverall seasonality discipline prescribed above, sh all be adopted by SLCCCI.  \\n16.6  Keeping in view the specifi c nature of crop and scope for catastrophic crop damage, SLCCCI shall fix \\nseasonality in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also \\nensure early payment of claims to eligible insured farme rs. Scheme also has provisions for claims \\ndue to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop. Hence, State  Govt. will take all \\nnecessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the Scheme. \\nNo request/relaxation for extension in the above seasonality/cut- off dates shall be considered/ \\ngranted by  GoI once it is fixed and notifie d for the crop season. However, preponement in cut off dates \\nshall be considered on case to case basis. If any State/ UT extends the above seasonality/ cut off dates \\non their -own, then Central share of premium subsidy shall not be provided for the concerne d notified \\ncrops /areas.  \\n16.7  It may be noted that, under no circumstance, will DAC&FW or any State/UT Govt.   extend the cut -\\noff dates for enrolment of farmers . However, in case the States/ UT decide to do so, it may be done only \\nin agreement with implementing  Insurance Company. In such cases, however no central premium \\nsubsidy will be provided for the areas/farmers/crops which are covered/ insured in the extended \\nperiod and the concerned State has to bear the entire subsidy liability for the coverage in the \\nextended period.  \\n16.8  In a situation where total claims have been approved/auto approved, the company shall be liable to \\npay claims within 2 weeks of calculation/auto approval of claims irrespective of whether Insurance \\nCompanies have raised the bill for 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy or not. Hence, it is binding on the \\nInsurance Company to seek the 2nd Instalment of premium subsidy within the timelines.  \\n16.9  All admissible claims shall mandatorily be paid within the stipulated cutoff date failing which penal \\ninterest @ 12% per annum shall be payable on admissible pending claims beyond 30 days of uploading \\nAY on portal/provided in soft copy by State Govt. subject to release of applicable subsidy by State \\nGovt . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  21 17.  Collection of Proposals and Premium from Farmers  \\n17.1  The Nodal Bank system adopted under NAIS/ NCIP* wherein the implementing Insurance Company is \\nnot required to deal with all the loan disbursing points and instead deals only with designated Nodal \\nbanks, will continue under PMFBY only for Cooperative Banks , However , for Commercial Banks/RRBs, \\nthe individual bank branches shall act as Nodal branch for this purpose. The concerned Lead bank and \\nRegional offices/ Administrative offices of Commercial banks/RRBs will provide necessary guidelines  to \\nconcerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches \\ncompulsorily remit the farmers premium electronically through NEFT/RTGS to be routed through NCIP \\nto concerned  Insurance Companies and submit the consolidated propo sals/information in prescribed \\nformat  well within the stipulated cut -off dates and also upload the details of individual \\ncovered/insured farmers  on National Crop Insurance  Portal. Besides, for the coverage of non -loanee \\nfarmers only, Insurance Company m ay also use IRDAI approved micro insurance agents/ insurance \\nintermediaries. However, details of such agents should compulsorily be submitted to State Govt. and \\nGovt. of India well before the start of the season for creating their credentials and subsequen t \\nuploading of details of individual insured/covered farmers on Portal within stipulated timelines.  \\n17.2  Consolidated declaration/ proposal formats to be submitted physically/ electronically by Nodal \\nbanks/Branches shall contain details about Insurance Unit, sum insured per unit, premium per unit, \\ntotal area insured of the farmers, number and category of farmers covered (small and marginal or \\nother)and number of farmers under other categories(SC/ST/others)/Women along with their bank \\naccount details etc.(bank/ their branches) as per the application form provided on the National Crop \\nInsurance Portal. Banks are required to upload the insured farmers’ data mandatorily on the National \\nCrop Insurance  Portal. No other platform shall be used for uploading/submission o f farmers’ data. \\nThose farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall only be eligible for \\nInsurance coverage and accordingly the premium subsidy will also be released. In cases where farmers   \\nare denied crop insurance due to i ncorrect/ partial/non -uploading of their details on Portal, concerned \\nBanks/Intermediaries shall be responsible for payment of claims to them  \\n17.3  In order  to facilitate  timely release of Govt. subsidy and remittance of claims to the farmers. entry \\nof detailed  information of all insured farmers on NCIP is  essential  fo r all bank  branches /PACS/ \\nCSCs/In termediaries/designated insurance agents  and Insurance Companies  \\n17.4  Loanee farmers (Compulsory coverage)  \\n17.4.1  Whenever banks sanction loan fo r a notified c rop in a no tified a rea, the crop l oan amount to the \\nextent of notifi ed Sum Insured (equivale nt to DLTC/SLTC approved Scale of Finance)  for notified \\ncrop and acreage of individual notified crop of loanee farmer shall be taken into consideration for \\ncompulsory coverage, as per seasonality discipline. Based on seasonality of crop, banks should \\nseparately calculate the eligibility of loan am ount for both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the Scale \\nof Finance and declared acreage under notified crops. Disbursing bank branch/ PACS  will prepare \\nstatement of crop -wise and insurance unit -wise details of crop insurance with premium as per the \\nseason ality discipline. Loan disbursing bank branch/ PACS shall finance additional loan equal to the \\npremium amount payable by farmer for crop insurance.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  22 17.4.2  For insurance coverage of a farmer, SI amount for a notified crop will be equivalent to Scale of Finance \\ndefined in the Govt. notification and uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal for the \\nconcerned notified crop and season. The total Sum Insured of loanee farmer for the season shall be \\ncalculated accordingly. The compulsory coverage shall solely be based on the  sanctioned / renewal of \\ncredit limit for notified crop for the season only and will be independent of disbursed \\namount/withdrawals. Farmers availing/renewing the KCC loans for Kharif & Rabi crops after cut -off \\ndate (renew/sanction period) for the season will be eligible for cover under crop insurance for the \\nnext/following crop season subject to the loan being standard loan and cut -off-date of premium debit \\nfor the season. In order to eliminate excess insurance and subsequent application of Area C orrection \\nFactor(ACF), care should be taken by the banks to ensure that only correct acreage under each \\ndeclared crop in loan application is considered for compulsory coverage of notified crop and not the \\nactual total acreage,. Banks will be liable for aud it and inspection on account of excess Insurance/ACF.  \\n17.4.3  Benefit of add on products viz., prevented sowing/ on account payment for Mid season adversity/ \\nlocalized calamity will be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium / the premium \\nhas bee n debited from their account before the damage notification by the State Govt. for invoking \\nthis provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure  that they debit farmers premium within 15 \\ndays from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks  will be liable to meet the claim \\nliabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium \\nat least one month before cut- off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction \\nhappens within one mon th of cut -off date, banks may daily debit premium for such accounts.  \\n17.4.4  Detailed example for C alculation of crop -wise Sum Insured for the season for compulsory coverage is \\ngiven in Table 3 below:   \\n  Crop 1  Crop 2  Crop 3  Crop 4  Crop 5  Crop 6  \\nTotal Land Ownership (Ha)  8 \\nKharif  Rabi  \\nName of Crop  Paddy  Maize  Cotton  Wheat  Potato  Gram  \\nActual Sown Area (Ha) under the crop 5 2 1 6 1 1 \\nArea (Ha) declared in KCC application  2 1 1 2 1 1 \\nCrop Season  Kharif  Rabi  \\nScale of Finance (Rs./Ha)  50,000  40,000  60,000  50,000  70,000  30,000  \\nTotal Sanctioned Sub limit for crop cultivation  1,00,000  40,000  60000  1,00,000  70,000  30,000  \\nSeason -wise sub limit for crop cultivation  2,00,000  2,00,000  \\nAdditional loan amount for consumption and \\nmaintenance of machinery etc (max.

How ever, any losses to the Govt. including excess payment of premium subsidy \\ndue to delayed/non - verification of data/information of individual covered/insured farmers on crop \\ninsurance Portal will be  recovered from concerned Insurance Companies only.  \\n17.14   Banks will ensure distribution of Acknowledgement Receipt along with Folio to each insured farmer \\nwithin  7 days from the acceptance of applications by the concerned insurance company. The \\nAcknowledgement Receipt will be generated through National Crop Ins urance Portal itself.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  28 18.   Assessment of Loss / Shortfall in Yield  \\n18.1  Wide Spread Calamities (based on season -end yield):  The Scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area \\n Approach’ i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities and insurance unit is \\n Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be \\n the same unit or a unit of size higher than Village/  Village Panchayat level, to be decided by the State/ \\n UT Govt.. State Govt. Department overseeing conduct of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut -off date \\n decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs (conducted through smart phone using CCE  \\n Agri App) on National Crop Insurance Portal. Yield data so arrived at will be approved/  uploaded by \\n the concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.  \\n18.2  CCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance  for notified crops*,on a sliding scale, as \\n indicated in Table 4 below:  \\nSl. \\nNo. Level  Minimum sample size  \\n1 District  24 \\n2 Taluka/Tehsil/Block  16 \\n3 Mandal/ Firka /Revenue Circle/Hobli or any other equivalent unit  10 \\n4 Village/Village Panchayat  4 \\n  * Minor crops may be notified at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level.  \\n18.3  In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the \\n modalities mentioned below will be followed:  \\n18.3.1  To bring better transparency and confidence in the data, States shall mandatorily ensure 100% CCEs \\nthrough a mobile application specially designed by Govt. of India for this purpose. No other application \\nshall be used for  conducting CCEs. CCE plots for conducting CCEs shall be chosen through random \\nselection or preferably using RST and secrecy of the selected plot should be maintained until the CCE \\nis actually conducted in order to rule out moral hazards.  \\n18.3.2   In order to prov ide proper benefits to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss \\nexperience, crop should be notified at lowest level i.e.  Village/Village Panchayat  \\n18.3.3   State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balance s. Digitizing \\nthe CCE process including geo -coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ \\ntime - stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs( para \\n20.4)  \\n18.3.4   Wherever external agencies are  proposed to be used by the State Govts. for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs \\nare out -sourced), it should be given only to the registered ‘professional/accredited’ agencies with \\nadequate experience in agricultural field activities/yield estimation. It is mandato ry for these agencies \\nto follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may \\nalso be utilized for assessment of Post -harvest loss and losses due to localized risks.  \\n18.3.5   States shall maintain same procedure and methodology for conducting CCEs as adopted by NSSO or  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  29 State Manual for Crop Production estimation  \\n18.3.6   District level Steering Committee : State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in \\neach district t o plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of \\nyield data to the State Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by District level \\nHead of Department/Organisation responsible for conducting CCE s. Distr ict Agriculture/Cooperative \\nofficers, representatives of SSO and Insurance Companies shall be members. The Steering committee \\nwill compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies so that they shall be well \\ninformed about each and every ac tivity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning, \\nschedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and \\nindividual CCE result etc. Head of Steering Committee wil be responsible for uploading of all requisite \\ninformation on National Crop Insurance Portal i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and \\nimparting training to field functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will \\ncompulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State. \\nConcerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of \\nhead of Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and \\nobtainin g the information of CCEs etc. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics \\nat the office for the insurance company official.  \\n18.3.7   In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non -availability of \\nadequate cropp ed area, adverse weather conditions/inadequate infrastructure etc. the yield estimate \\nfor such IUs can be generated by using methods such as (i) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, \\nor (ii) adopting the yield of a neighbouring IU with maximum corre lation. Priority of applicability of \\naforesaid two methods should be notified by the concerned States in the notification itself, failing \\nwhich option of yield estimate of next higher unit only would be considered. However, this clause shall \\nonly be applic able in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units \\nand cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs.  Special efforts should be made by the State to \\nconduct adequate no. CCEs in all notified units in order to provide appr opriate benefits to farmers.  \\n18.3.8   In case of multi -picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) & \\nother crops of similar nature,  following procedure shall be followed.  \\n18.3.8.1   State needs to, in the beginning;  specify the number of required picking for each crop both for \\nirrigated and un -irrigated conditions. Ideally it should be as per NSSO/IASRI defined guidelines, if it is \\nnot available , State in consultation with local Agriculture Universities  and concerned  ICAR cent er may \\nidentify the required number of pickings. However number of actual picking depends on climatic \\nconditions etc. Hence possibility of further pickings  of each picking  should compulsorily be recorded in \\nCCE app and no. of actual picking will be final in such cases . \\n18.3.8.2  If the required number of CCEs have been done and the required number of picking have not being \\ndone , then for those experiments , factors need to be used to extrapolate yield to the final yield.  \\n18.3.8.3  The factors (proportion of picking wise yield) need to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with \\nthe required number of pickings) from the same  Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un -irrigated \\ncondition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.    \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  30 An Ex ample for Yield Calculation  for multi- picking crop  is mentioned in Table 5 below:  \\nCrop  Experiment no.

Accordingly the picking dates and number will \\nbe adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in \\nDecember and one experiment has shown first picking i n December it will be considered as second \\npicking.  \\n18.3.8.5  If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the  Taluka level even, it should be \\nconsidered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard \\nOperating  Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and \\nweather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having \\nfurther pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile  application/ CCE -Agri App while \\nconducting t he current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for \\ncalculation of AY.   \\nThe Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through onlin e \\nCCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified \\nand approved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were \\nconducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual  Yield data, along with the location \\ninformation shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on \\nthe Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed \\n5% of total CCEs . Actual Yield data through any other mo de other than through National Crop  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  31 Insurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within \\npre-defined cut -off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned I nsurance Company , \\nmay inform State Govt . /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action.  \\n18.3.8.6  Insurance Company should be given complete access to co -witness the CCEs, the digital images of the \\nCCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time \\nbasis ( Para  35.2.11 ). A schedule  should be formally given/  shared with Insurance Companies \\nsufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize \\ntheir man power accordingly.   For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one \\nrepresentative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper \\nday to day liaison ( Para  18.3.6).  State shall provide necessary space  in the concerned office & facilitate \\nsharing of information . \\n19.  Dispute resolution regarding Yield Data/Crop loss  \\n19.1  It has been seen, during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, there are various types of yield \\ndisputes, which unnecessarily delays the  claim settlement. Following figure shows the procedures to \\nbe adopted in various cases . \\n Figure. Procedures to be followed in different yield dispute cases  \\n \\n19.2  Wherever  the yield estima tes re ported at IU le vel are ab normally low or high vis -à-vis the general crop \\ncondition the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of various products \\n(e.g. Satellite based Vegetation In dex, Weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including \\nstatistical test, crop models etc.) to confirm  yield estimates. If Insurance Company witnesses any \\nanomaly/deficiency in the actual yield data(partial /consolidated) received from the State Govt., the \\n \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  32 same shall be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of \\nreceip t of yield data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and \\nanomaly, if any, may be resolved  in next 7 days by the  State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC)  \\nheaded by Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department. This \\ncommittee shall be authorized to decide all such cases and the decision in such cases shall be final. The \\nSLCC may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC)  for dispute resolution \\n(Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5 ). In case the matter stands unresolved even after \\nexamination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes \\nof meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and SLCC . Reference to TAC can be made \\nthereafter only in conditions specified in P ara 19.7.1 However, data with anomalies which is not \\nreported within 7  days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines \\ndefined above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State \\ndepartment in batches, i.e. Crop -wise -District -wise lots of data and tim elines for each batch of data \\nshall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of yield data will attract \\npenal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the SLCC  in the matter.  \\n19.3  The existing Technical Advis ory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of \\nEconomics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI,  will be further augmented and  constituted \\nunder the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW and additional  members depending on \\ncase to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian \\nCouncil of Agriculture Research (ICAR),  Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote \\nSensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centr e (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO), \\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), \\nNational Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD)  \\nor any other su ch organisation.  \\n19.4  The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case, \\nthe matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency (as \\ndefined in the SOP for yield dis pute). Technical Agency (TA)  will compulsorily take \\ninput/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and \\nmay also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of \\nchairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP.  \\n19.5  State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to \\nresolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary  of the concerned \\ndepar tment with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state \\ncentre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the \\nconcerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for \\nfurther deliberation/examination and decision.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  33 19.6  TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions \\nbased on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and t echnical parameters as \\ndetailed in the SOP.  \\n19.7  The SOP to deal with yield dispute cases  is as under:  \\n19.7.1  When to use this SOP : This SOP will be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield \\nvalues between the State Government and the Insurance Company and this has not been resolved at \\nSLCC level and STAC ( Para 19.2) and the matter has been referred to the Central Gove rnment \\nTechnical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a \\nTechnical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following \\nconditions are satisfied.   All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their \\ndecision shall be final and binding on all concerned.  \\n• There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the \\ninsurance company.  \\n• There is sufficient document ary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required \\nnumber and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the IUs for the particular crop \\nin the Cluster.  \\n• The matter has  been considered by the SLCC  and STAC  but could not be resolv ed at State level.  \\n• The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State \\nGovt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to \\nsupport its claim.  \\n \\n19.7.2  The Organizat ions to which TAC can refer the  case  to: The organizations can be Central Govt.  or \\nautonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity  to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC \\n(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non -government organizations (e.g. \\nCCAFS -BISA- CGIAR), as decided by TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical \\nAgencies.  \\n \\n19.7.3  Data to be provided by State Government :  \\n• All CCEs data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs \\nand other collateral data, as collected during CCE. The CCE data should be ideally geo referenced.  \\n• Village level crop area estimates.  \\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at  Taluka/block \\nlevel) in digital format, (preferably Excel)  \\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if no t \\navailable, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, \\nrainy days and temperature, in digital format, (preferably Excel)  \\n• Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rain fall or any \\nother natural/ manmade disasters in that area  \\n• Report of any analysis carried out by the States to support its claim   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  34  \\n19.7.4  Data to be provided by Insurance Company:  \\n• Data of the co -observed CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital form at, (preferably \\nExcel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during CCE  \\n• Data of weather observatories*, if maintained or sourced  by Insurance Companies, in the contested \\narea  \\n• Report of the technical studies* carried out by the Ins urance Company to support its claim.  \\n• Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested.  \\n• Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area  \\n (*This data shall only be considered where prior approval for such agency has been taken from State \\nGovt . as outlined in para 2.13 ) \\n  \\n19.7.5  Analysis to be carried out by the Technical Agency :  \\n Among the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed from a to d and an y one step should be \\nfollowed from e to f. The steps in g and h are compulsory.  \\n• Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data : Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range, \\nStandard Error, etc.)  Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro -Wilk test, Quartile-  Quartile plot, \\nWhiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It  also needs to be checked whether CCEs were \\ndone using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify \\nreasons for lower number of CCE.  \\n• Analysis of Weather Data : Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at  grid level using \\ngridded or satellite based data, Dry -spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis \\n(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop \\ncondition), either from ground or satelli te data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be \\nstudied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall \\ndata or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground \\nstations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree \\ndata should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather \\ndata can also be sourced from weather companies.  \\n• Analysis of  Long -term Yield Data : Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or  Taluka level) analysis \\nshould be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean \\nyield, standard deviation, and CV.  \\n• Analysis of Other collateral data : Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop \\nWeather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme  crop reports, drought \\nassessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2 -3 years \\n(http://agmarknet.gov.in/ ), crop condition data available on VEDAS platform \\n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/ ), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather \\nbulletins, weather info rmation/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/ ),   \\netc. \\n• Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this \\npurpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  35 (NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health \\nIndex (VHI), Enh ance Vegetation Index (EVI),  etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of \\nappropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).  \\n  Table 6  : Types  of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of \\nanalysis  \\nLevel of \\nAnalysis  Spatial \\nResolution  \\nto be used Examples of Satellite/Sensor  \\nVillage level  5-10 m or \\nbetter  Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid  Eye (6.5 \\nm); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m)  \\nBlock/Tehsil \\nlevel  10-30 m  Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI \\n(10 m)  \\nDistrict level  50-100 m  Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m)  \\n However, wherever long -term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should \\nnot be used for village level for information.  Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop \\nmaps should be overlaid on the data.  Generally f or few major crops, crop maps are prepared under \\nFASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote \\nsensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution.  Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least \\nagricultural area m ap should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest \\n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.   \\n• Crop Growth Modelling:  Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such a s \\nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi -physical modelling approach can also be used \\nfor crop growth analysis.  However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated \\nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolutio n, at least 5 km.  \\n• Identification of Outliers : All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any \\nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. \\nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remo te sensing vegetation indices (single or \\ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters, \\nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.  \\nWhatever, yield proxi es to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record \\ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the \\nparticular crop’s yield.  Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield pro xy map. Both \\nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4 -5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, \\nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2 \\nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be conside red, as outliers.  \\n• Computing Yield for the Outliers : For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield \\nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long -term \\nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote \\nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  36 The final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The \\nweightage to be g iven to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or \\nModel). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo \\nlocation, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estim ates, if \\nmodel is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant \\nthe average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may \\nhave specific and special cause related to a p roblem and may not be considered as a reference for \\nany other case.)  Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm \\nrainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post -harvest stage has different impacts; a small \\namount rainfall having devastating wind -speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall \\nhaving calm or no -wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to \\nconsider each of the cases as an individual and special case.  \\n \\n19.7.6  Time required for the analysis : The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical \\nagency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State \\nGovernment.  \\n \\n19.7.7  Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its \\nexisting resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may \\nbe funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever orga nization has \\nbrought the dispute issue up to TAC.  \\n \\n19.7.8  General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long \\nrun, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions  are made \\nto avoid dispute.  \\n• The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and \\ncollect the data using Smartphone based Android App  \\n• States need to pro -actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimatio n \\n• States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State \\nlevel organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres \\nlocated in the State, local IMD office, etc.  \\n• The Insuran ce Companies  should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs.  \\n• The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss \\nassessment.  \\n• There should be better coordination between the State and the In surance Companies.  \\n   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  37 20.  Use   of   Innovative Technologies  \\n20.1  To Rationalize CCEs:  With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging \\ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.  \\nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference \\nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the \\ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health . This feature can be successfully used to target \\nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’ \\n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number  of CCEs, to make them \\nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce  the total need of CCEs by about \\n30-40%  while maintaining similar accuracy . It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it \\nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU an d not just location of 4 CCEs.  States can adopt this \\ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in \\ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For  \\nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under \\nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25, \\npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to \\nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized \\ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be \\nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop \\nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a \\nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This  can be done in consultation \\nwith MNCFC, NRSC  (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department  has also been piloting such \\nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.  \\n20.2  To remove Area Discrepancy in c overage:  It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, \\narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery, \\ndigitization of land records needs to be done  to minimize the area discrepancy. For this d etailed \\nprocedure has been laid down in section  25  \\n20.3  For Direct Yield Estimation  \\n20.3.1   For addressing the issue of r eliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy , representativeness and \\ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as  satellite remote sensing , drone, modeling, AWS/ARG,  real \\ntime transmission of data etc. should  be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and \\ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international \\norganizations, including MNC FC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the \\nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various \\nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and \\nsupport timely claim processing and payments.  \\n20.3.2   States, with the support of nation al centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out \\nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mention ed  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  38 above, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant  correlation is observed between \\nremote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance \\nCompanies can use these technologies in estimating the cro p yields at IU level, subject to the \\nsatisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to \\nservice the claims.  \\n20.4  To improve Yield -data Quality and Timeliness  \\n \\n20.4.1   It has been observed that the normall  CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is \\nlacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real \\ntime, good quality and reliable  actual yield -data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held \\ndevices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri -app. RST using satellite and drones , weather data, \\nmodel  etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation \\nthrough CCEs.  \\n20.4.2   The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand \\nheld devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and S tate \\nGovts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by \\nCentral Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones \\nand other related costs  (RST, Drone, etc).  \\n20.5  Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for \\nmeeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt. \\nfunds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with exc ess farmers share of premium surrendered \\nby Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on \\naccount of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2  \\n21.  Assessment of Claims  \\n21.1  Wide Spread Calamities  \\n21.1.1   If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite \\nnumber of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers \\ngrowing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in \\nyield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.  \\n ‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:  \\n       (Threshold Yield – Actual Yield)  \\n                             ———————————————        X     Sum Insured  \\n                                                          Threshold Yield  \\n Where Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years \\nfrom pas t seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop  \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  39 21.1.2   Illustration  \\n In table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of “X”. \\nCalculation of TY for Rabi 2014 -15 season is given in Table 7 below : \\nYear  2008 -09 2009 -10 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 2014 -15 \\nYield(kg/ha)  4500  3750  2000  4250  1800  4300  1750  \\n The years of 2012 -13 and 2014 -15 have the lowest yields.  \\n Total of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is  3550kg/ha \\ni.e.(1800+1750).  Therefore according to the provision, average of best five years excluding two lowest \\nyield years will be (22350 –3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% \\nof indemnity levels will be  3384kg/ha, 3008kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively.  \\n21.2  On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid- Season Adversity  \\n21.2.1   Insurance cover will be provided to the farmers to provide immediate relief in case of adverse \\nseasonal conditions during the crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc., \\nwherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Normal  Yield.  \\n21.2.2   Eligibility Criteria : \\n21.2.2.1  All notified IUs would be eligible for “ON ACCOUNT” payment only if the expected Yield of the affected \\ncrop during the season is less than 50% of  Normal Yield . \\n21.2.2.2  The provision could be invoked for a specific crop or group of crops in notified IU, by the State Govt. \\nthrough damage notification based on the proxy indicators and depending on fulfilment of laid down \\nconditions  \\n21.2.2.3  The quantum of likely losses and the amount of ‘on -account’ payment  shall be decided  based on the \\njoint survey by Insurance Company and State Govt. officials.  \\n21.2.2.4  Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the \\npremium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the \\nState Govt. for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks mu st ensure to debit farmers premium \\nwithin 15 days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan to provide benefit of this add on products , \\nfailing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible famers.  \\n21.2.2.5   Amount payable would be 2 5% of the likely claims, subject to adjustment against final claims.  \\n21.2.2.6  If adversity occurs within 15 days before the normal harvest time, this provision will not be invoked.  \\nThen the losses will not qualify under this provision.  \\n21.2.3   Proxy -Indicators : Indicator s to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather data, \\nsatellite imagery, drought assessment reports of MNCFC and crop condition reports by district level/ \\nState Govt. officials, supported by media report and field photographs. The St ate’s notification should \\nalso spell out all the necessary details in this regard.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  40 21.2.4   Loss assessment procedure : \\n21.2.4.1  Joint Committee of State Govt. and the Insurer for assessment of crop damage have  to be formed and \\nnotified before start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district.  \\n21.2.4.2  This Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for On -Account payment based on the weather data \\n(available AWS notified by the Govt.)/long term average rainfall data/satellite imagery supported by \\nestimated yield losses at n otified IU level.

Out of which 50 \\ninsurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro -met data, it has been \\nassessed that 30 IUs could ha ve yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield . Out of these 30 \\ninsurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category -I), for another 10 units, it is 70% \\n(Category -II) and remaining 1 5units, it is 60% (Category -III) of normal average yield. As per declarations \\nreceived, if sum insured for notified areas in Category -I, Category -II and Category -III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 \\ncrore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will b e Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, \\nrespectively.

However, \\nfor settlement of On -Account payment of claims, prevented sowing/planting/germination claims and \\nLocalized calamity claims, advance subsidy  (1st instalment)  of  50% of 80% of respe ctive Central/State \\nGovt. share in corresponding previous season should have been received for the season/area(s)  \\n23.2  Threshold Yield for all notified crops at each IU level shall compulso rily be part of the notification for \\nthe season and shall not change at any point during that season. Crop -IU wise historical Average Yield, \\nCalamity Years, Indemnity level and Threshold Yield shall be uploaded on the Portal by the concerned \\nState Nodal Depart ment at the time of release of notification only and shall be verified and accepted \\nby the concerned Insurance Company within given timelines. In order to avoid manipulation/misuse of \\ninformation at field level, threshold Yield shall not be a part of publi c information before payment of \\nclaims for that season.  \\n23.3  The DLMC will be required to upload/enter the details of crop loss as per the Joint Loss Survey \\nconducted by DLJC for all intermediate loss events viz. prevented sowing/planting/germination failure \\n&Mid -season Adversity on the National Crop Insurance Portal. Similarly, the crop loss details for \\nlocalized losses and post -harvest loss events shall be entered by the concerned Insurance Company on \\nthe Portal. Once the Actual Yield data is available on th e Portal, the same shall be verified and \\napproved by the concerned District/State authorities.  For those experiments which were conducted \\noffline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data shall be uploaded by the concerned District \\nadministration or State nodal department on the Portal itself.  \\n23.4  The loss reports and Actual Yield data shall be approved/ reverted ( in case of any discrepancy/concern \\non the authenticity/correctness of report/data) by the Insurance Company based on which the eligible \\nclaims shall be calculated through the Portal and accordingly the payment of claims shall be initiated \\nby the concerned Insurance Company and remitted directly into beneficiary account as per pre -\\ndefined timelines. The application wise payment details viz. am ount, reference number, date etc. shall \\nbe entered/  synchronised with the National Crop Insurance Portal for future reference and audit \\npurpose.  \\n23.5  In case of widespread calamity (end of season claims ), once yield data is received/finalized from State \\nGovt. as per the cut -off-dates decided, claims will be worked out on the National Crop Insurance Portal \\nas per declarations/ approved proposals & covered farmer’s data received from banks / channel \\npartners / insurance intermediaries for each notified area and c rops and accordingly the claims will be \\napproved by Competent Authority of implementing Insurance Company.  \\n23.6  In case of farmers covered through Financial Institution, claims shall be released only through \\nelectronic transfer directly into insured farmer’s g iven bank account, followed by details containing \\nclaim particulars, to individual bank branches/ nodal banks; Bank Branch should also display particulars  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  56 of claim disbursal on notice board  to enable spread of awareness and inclination amongst farming \\ncomm unity for risk mitigation through crop insurance. Insurance Company is required to compulsorily \\nupload the claim details against each insured farmer on National crop insurance Portal.  \\n23.7  In case of farmers covered on voluntary basis through intermediaries, p ayable claim s will direc tly be \\ncredite d to the bank accounts of concerned insured farmers and deta ils of th e claims may also be \\nintimated to them. The list of beneficiaries shall also be uploaded on National  Crop Insurance Portal \\nimmed iately.  \\n23.8  In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post - harvest losses; Insurance \\nCompany  will process the claim s after assessment and sh all release th e claims as  per detailed \\nproc edure given in the relevant sections above.  \\n23.9  The claim settlement intimation shall be sent to each beneficiary farmer through SMS from the Portal \\nitself. State Govts, Banks &  Insurance companies shall ensure correctness of data before hand viz. \\nThreshold Yield, Actual Yield, Insured Area, Sum Insured and Indemnity levels  etc. Responsibility of any \\nerror, omissions and mis -reporting shall lie with the concerned State Nodal Department and insurance \\nCompany. State Govt. &  Insurance Companies shall resolve all the gri evances of the insured far mers \\nand other stakeholders in th e shortest possible time.  \\n23.10   In any situation, State Govt. can not reopen/ re calculate claims after 30 days of claims settlement for \\nnotified crop(s) at notified unit . Disputed claims / sub -standard claims , if any, due to erroneous data  \\nmay be referred wi thin this time to SLCC/STAC  and further to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), if \\nrequired, for consideration and decision  \\n24.  Important Conditions /Clauses Applicable for Coverage of Risks  \\n24.1  Insurance companies should have received the premium for c overage either from bank , channe l \\npartner, insuranc e intermediary or directly. In case o f any loss in transit due to negligence by these \\nagencies or non remittance of premium by these agencies, the concerned bank/intermediaries shall be \\nliable for payment of claim s. \\n24.2  In case of any substantial misreporting by nodal bank /branch in c ase of compulsory farmers \\ncoverage, the concerned bank only shall be liable for such mis -reporting.  \\n24.3  Mere sanctioning/ disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals/ declaration s and \\nremittance of premium by farmer/bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, does not constitute \\nacceptance of risk by Insurance Company . \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  57 25.  Acreage discrepancy  \\n25.1  Some  areas  in the past  have  reported  excess  insurance  coverage  vis-à-vis planted  acreage,  leading to over -\\ninsurance.   Ideally  the discrepancy  should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers \\nwith genuine insurance  coverage.  All suitable  measures  are being taken  by concerned stakeholders for \\nde duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and \\nproposal/loan application of insured farmers.  The details of individual insured farmers are being \\ncollected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absen ce of digitized \\nfarm records on a GIS platform  and its integration with the Portal , it would  be cumbersome  to \\nphysically  verify  each  farm  when  the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the \\nsown areas.   Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which \\nis not being included in sowing areas  furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of \\ncrop the during the season . State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in \\nconsul tation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.  \\n25.2  Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of \\nactuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and r esultant \\nclaims on the application of ACF . However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the \\nresponsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the \\ncrop which farmer actually intend to sow /actually s own.  Option to change the insured crop has also \\nbeen provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is \\nalso a provision to indemnify th e crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of \\nindividual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to \\nforfeiting of claims , if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.       \\n25.3  Area Discrepancy will be applied only to  those major crop s for which Normal area sown data at the \\nBlock/Taluka level  shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring \\nthe areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions  and \\nshall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal.  No other data from any source including \\nState Govt. will be considered.  \\n25.4  However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published \\ncultivable area at Taluka level should com pulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW , in writing  \\nafter cut  off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with \\nfacts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government \\nand rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal  \\n25.5  Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all.  \\n25.6  If the difference between insured area and sown area  provided by MNCFC   is >30% at Block/Tehsil / \\nTaluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be \\ntreated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.  \\n25.7 Data on application of ACF shal l be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.    \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  58 25.8  Accordingly excess insured area shall be treated as un -insured and corresponding farmer’s premium \\nwill be forfeited and the same will be surrendered to Technology Fund of GOI  and may be utilized for \\nleveraging technology in PMFBY for improvement of technology/research/Impact assessment etc and \\ntowards assistance to States for cost of incremental CCEs  \\n25.9  Premium subsidy refunded by ICs due to application of ACF shall be refunded to Central/State Govt. in \\nration of 50:50   \\n26.  Publicity and Awareness  \\n26.1  Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible \\nmeans of electronic and print media, farmer’s fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries \\nshall be utilized to create and disse minate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme \\namong the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/ \\nCooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and \\npublicit y on an on -going basis from three months  prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly, \\nInsurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work. \\nAll the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance \\nPortal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc.  \\n26.2  The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity \\nbuilding of the associated agents, banks etc for effective imp lementation of the Scheme and organize \\ntraining workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance \\nCompanies.  \\n26.3  Insurance company should spend 0.5 % of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field \\nlevel and  the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every \\nseason. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall \\ndeposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cu t off date for enrolment.  \\n27.

Monitoring and Review of the Scheme  \\n29.1  State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) of the concerned State will be  \\nresponsible for monitoring of the Schemes/ programme in its  State. However, a National Level \\nMonitoring Committee (NLMC) und er the chairmanship of Secretary , DAC & FW will monitor the \\nScheme at the national level.  \\n29.2  It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop \\nseason to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers:  \\n29.2.1   The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both \\nloanee and non -loanee) like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number,  Aadhaar number  village, \\ncategories – small and marginal/SC/ST/ women, insured acreage, insured crop(s),  sum insured, \\npremium collected, Govt. subsidy etc and submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration \\nmodule along with  electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cut -\\noff date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to \\nthe concerned Insurance Company  by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of \\nindividual c rop. \\n29.2.2   Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area \\ndata but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall \\nimmediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final \\nreceipt of actual yield data  as detailed in section 25 . \\n29.2.3   Insurance Companies shall calculate crop -wise, IU wise payable claims based on the actual yield data \\nand threshold yield given at the time of tendering. Accordingly the payable claims subject to payment  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  60 of full premium share by the Central and State Govt for the season shall be remitted by the Insurance \\nCompanies directly into benefitted farmer’s accounts electronically, payment details for which shall be \\nupdated on the National Crop Insurance Portal on daily basis.  \\n29.2.4   After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial \\ninstitutions/banks should display the list of the beneficiaries/details of claims (both loanee and non -\\nloanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of \\nfarmers/beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc.  \\n29.2.5   The list of beneficiaries (Bank -wise and insured area- wise) shall also be uploaded/ placed on  the \\nwebsite of the concerned Insurance Companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public \\ngrievance redressal/feed -back etc . State Govts./UT should ensure that crop insurance products \\nprovide comprehensive insurance coverage to the farmers on sound insurance principles and provide \\nthe best value for the premium. State Govt. may also review the progress of Scheme periodically and \\nundertake impact assessment after the completion of each season and send their suggestion/ \\nrecommen dations to this Department for making further improvements in the Scheme.  \\n29.2.6   About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by Regional Offices/Local level Offices of ICs who will \\nsend the feedback to concerned DLMC and State Govt./SLCCCI on Crop Insurance.  \\n29.2.7   At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the IC may be cross verified by the concerned DLMC and \\nthey should send the feed back to State Govt.  \\n29.2.8   1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Office of the IC/Independent Agencies \\nappointed by the Central Govt./NLMC and they should send the necessary feed back to Central \\nGovernment.  \\n30.

This Committee may also \\ninvite subject specialists/experts fr om University/IMD/research institutions/commodity Boards/, State \\nRemote Sensing Agency, STSU, STAC etc. if deemed necessary. The Committee will dispose the \\ngrievance within 15 days time of receipt of grievance. The decision of the Committee shall be accept ed \\nby all the parties.  \\n \\n31.  Empanelment and Selection of Insurance Companies  \\n31.1  Empanelment Criteria  \\n31.1.1   The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC \\n& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The \\nInsurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate \\nexperience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC& FW. \\nOnce Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC & FW, it is considered as pre -qualified \\ncompany to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the \\nScheme/Programme of DAC& FW.  \\n31.1.2   L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines \\nafter being declared L1,  it will be de -empanelled/ de -barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for \\nthe coming/next season(s) in the concerned Stat e and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing \\nthe crop insurance Scheme at L1 district -crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their \\nconsent . All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for \\nwithdrawal /surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further \\ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to \\nthe State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selec ted bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing \\nL1 bidder.  \\n31.1.3   Tender should be  preferably for 3 years and in no case less than  1 year  \\n31.1.4   Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs  \\n \\n31.2  Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  62 31.2.1   The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as \\nImplementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the \\nScheme in their State. Selection of  IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller \\nStates, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.  \\n31.2.2   Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre -qualified companies \\nas mentioned in the preceding para th rough open tender  for submission of district -wise and crop-\\nwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level, \\nThreshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The  \\nempanell ed companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified \\n/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non -compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.  \\n31.2.3   Based on the district -wise and crop -wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre -qualified \\ncompanies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will \\nbe worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the \\nconcerned cluster.  \\n31.2.4   Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years  as mentioned above Such long \\nterm continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers \\nthrough investment out of the premium savings in variou s welfare activities for socio -economic \\ndevelopment of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthc are/education, \\nfarm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an \\nopportunity t o Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative \\ninteraction and business relationship and service effectiveness.  \\n31.2.5   The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level o f \\ncorresponding previous season.  In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and \\nnecessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if \\nfound at fault may be taken by GOI.   \\n31.2.6   State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more, \\nthreshold yield, crop -wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units, \\ncalamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself \\nbefore floating the formal tender notice.  \\n32.  Clustering / clubbing  of districts for bidding by the State  \\n In order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State \\nGovernment are req uired to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of \\ndistricts/ area with different risk profiles.  Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large \\nState have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon  volume of risk \\nassociated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purp ose of \\nclustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI) \\nbecomes low and risk is shared and diversified. State s may form the clusters of districts based on  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  63 mixed agro -climatic zones.  i) Districts of h igh risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro -\\nclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.  \\n Prior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the \\nInsurance Companies.  \\n The object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives: \\n• Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.  \\n• Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the \\ndiver sification of risk within a clu ster and enable risk spreading for insurer.  \\n• Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro -climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of \\nrisk within a cluster.  \\n• Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored  in \\ncluster formation.  \\n1. Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts.  As per 2016 \\nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 \\nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost \\n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability \\nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower \\nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.  \\n2.  Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for \\nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop \\nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby \\nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived \\nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to \\ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level \\nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO - NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned \\ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in \\nclustering.  \\n3.  These are only for guidance of States  and States are free to follow either of these or any other method \\ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.  \\n4.  The detail illustration for classification  of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and \\ndetermination of L1 bidder are at Annexure 1 . \\n \\n \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  64 33.  Assessment of Performance and De -empanelment of Insurance \\nCompanies  \\n33.1  The performance of the empanelled Insurance Companies shall be closely monitored by DAC & FW on \\n2 years interval through ascertaining the company’s skills and efficiencies for provid ing cost effective \\nbetter insurance services to farmers. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix \\ncontaining key performance indicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at \\nAnnexure 2.  \\n \\n34.  Evaluation of Efficiency of Nodal Department of the State  \\n34.1  The efficiency evaluation of the State Nodal Department shall also be closely monitored by DAC & FW \\non every 1 year interval through ascertaining the State’s efficiency and execution / implementation of \\nthe Scheme. For the purpose, a detailed performance evaluation matrix containing key performance \\nindicators with assigned weightage has been worked out and is as given at Annexure 3.  \\n \\n35.

Such service will include opening bank \\naccou nt of non- loanee farmers, guiding them to fill up proposal forms, accepting premium from them and \\nmaintaining records etc. \\n35.5.2.5 Ensure that the premium for both loanee and non -loanee farmers shall be remitted to concerned \\nInsurance Companies and the related data uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal within the \\nprescribed time.  \\n35.5.2.6 Lead bank/Administrative Offices of Banks should ensure that all farmers sanctioned   crop loans/seasonal \\noperational loans/KCC loan for notified crop(s) are compulsorily insured a nd the conditions stated  in the \\nOperational Guidelines of the Scheme have been complied with. No farmer should be deprived of \\ninsurance cover. Lead banks/ Administrative Offices of Banks therefore, should make all efforts and \\npursue their branches for enro lling all eligible loanee farmers and interested non -loanee farmers under \\ncrop insurance. In case, claims have arisen during crop season then respective bank and its branches \\nwould be made responsible to make payment of the admissible claims to loanee farm ers who were \\ndeprived from insurance cover to their crops.  \\n35.5.2.7 Concerned Bank and its branches should ensure upload/submission of notified crop -wise, insurance unit -\\nwise Declarations in prescribed format on National Crop Insurance Portal along with de tails of remittance \\nof premium within stipulated time. A copy/print out of declaration uploaded on Portal may also be \\nsubmitted to concerned Insurance Com panies, if so desired by them. The consolidated premium of \\nfarmers’ share will be remitted electronically  eith er through payment gateway of National Crop Insurance \\nPortal or RTGS/NEFT to Insurance Companies followed by compulsory entry of payment details on Portal \\nfor proper and timely reconciliation by ICs.

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop \\nInsurance Program (www.pmfby.go v.in)  \\n36.1   The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’  viz. farmers, Insurance Companies, \\nfinancial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration, \\ncoordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.  \\n36.2  The idea behind develo ping a web -based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify \\nfragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide \\nfaster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance \\n(www.pmfby.gov.in)  and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for \\ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of \\nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is \\nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby \\nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/lay ered information \\naccess, manual interventions, multi -step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective \\ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and \\nyield/weather data providers with N ational Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching \\nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst \\nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the \\nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it \\nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is \\navailable in two languages  – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.  \\n36.3  The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate \\nadministrative functions. A web -based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a \\nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically -weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance \\nservices.  \\n36.4  The conceptualisation and development of web -portal has already been completed and launched \\nhowever devel opment and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below \\nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.   \\n36.4.1   Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance \\nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed \\nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay -Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation \\nof funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement.  \\n36.4.2   Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company:  For \\nseamless and real- time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of \\nNational Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance  Companies will be \\nestablished. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange \\nplatform.   \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  76 • Farmer’s enrolment and premium remittance,  \\n• Information and reports regarding mid -term/preventive sowing/individual/localized claims and  \\n• AY/TY data for final claim calculation and remittance of claims into farmer’s bank account . \\n \\n36.4.3   Integration of Digital Land Records : Various State Govts. are working on digitization of land records \\nand providing facility to land owners to identify and take records of land parcels owned by them. The \\nsame digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal \\nfollowed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This \\nfacility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is \\nprevalent currently.  \\n36.4.4   Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic \\nWeather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges acro ss the country will be procured from IMD and \\nintegrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real- time monitoring of weather \\nparameters, agro -climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid -term \\nadversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather \\ndata to concerned Ins urance Companies and automated claim  calculation and remittance to \\nbeneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real- time information about crop loss and payable \\nclaims vis -a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy \\ndecisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken.  \\n36.4.5   Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For brin ging efficiency in addressing the grievances \\nof farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations \\nand resolution will be integrated with the Portal.   \\n36.4.6   Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web- Portal:  A quick response system is very \\ncrucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders. \\nKeeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all \\nthe stak eholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination.  \\n36.4.7   Development of Mobile -App for Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid -Term Loss Assessment and \\nreporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information s haring and reporting of \\nLocalized/Individual, Preventive/Mid -Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss \\nassessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop \\nInsurance Portal which will be  accessed by all the stakeholders. This will help in monitoring  and faster \\nanalysis and claim settlement.  \\n36.4.8   Integration of Interest Subvention Scheme with Crop Insurance: A web -portal for Interest Subvention \\nScheme is also being developed for monitoring and implementation of ISS. This Portal will be inter-\\nlinked with the National Crop Insurance Portal for automatic enrolment of eligible farmers and \\ndeduction of applicable premium. This will also enable de -duplication of KCC/seasonal Crop Loans and \\nprovisioning of services  \\n36.4.9   Integration of RST/Satellite Data for handling Data Discrepancy/dispute resolution: New Age \\nTechnologies like Remote Sensing Technology is a promising st ep in bringing in procedures and  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  77 systems of approach which is more reliable, accurate and fast in resolving errors/concerns of \\nstakeholders and provide a progressive and scientific solution which the traditional/existing \\nprocedures and practices are unable  to provide.

Such bidders will be required \\nto furnish appropriate reasons for withdrawal/surrender in writing to Ministry of Agriculture & \\nFarmer’s Welfare, Govt. of India within 10 days from opening of the bids to enable further \\ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action against defaulting bidders.  \\n  \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  82  Selection of Implementing Agency:  \\n Illustration: \\n \\nWeighted Premium Rate (%) for companies  \\nX Y Z \\n0.044289  0.046435  0.044221  \\n4.43%  4.64%  4.42%  \\n L1 in Cluster1 is company (Z) . Similar process would be followed other clusters.  \\n  Method 2  \\n Agriculture output in the area/ district is influenced by the agro -climatic conditions of that \\narea/district. On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last \\n10 years, districts may be divided in to three catego ries of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture. \\nIf variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus \\nminus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus \\nminus 16 -30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks \\ndistricts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as \\nlow/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of \\ndistricts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be \\ndivided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State. Then, equal no. of low risk districts shall be \\nselected randomly for each cluster of districts. Similarly, moderate and high risks districts would be \\nselected.  \\n Example:  \\n State–  UP, No. of districts –  75 \\n Basedonthelast10yearsvariationinoutput, category -wise No. of districts identified:  \\n Low risks 40, Moderate risks 20, High risks 15,  \\n No. of clusters (of preferably 15 -20 districts each) to be formed:   75/19 =3.95 say4  \\n Then, no. of low risks districts in each cluster: 40/4 = 10  \\n \\n Similarly, moderate risks districts: 20/4=5 and high risks districts: 15/4=3.75 say 4 As such,  \\n Sample calculation to find L1:  \\n  \\nwww.pmfby.gov.in  \\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY  83  Table -1: Calculation  to arrive  company’s  weighted  average  premium  in a district  of the cluster  \\nCluster    Formation of clusters    \\nNo. of low \\nrisks districts  No. of moderate \\nrisks districts  No. of high \\nrisks districts  Total districts \\nin cluster  \\nC 1 10 5 4 19 \\nC 2 10 5 4 19 \\nC 3 10 5 4 19 \\nC 4 10 5 3 18 \\n \\n District: D1 Company –Y \\nCrops Notified \\nin a District of \\nthe Cluster  Expected \\nArea to be \\ninsured (in \\nha) Notified SI \\nper ha \\n(Rs.)
