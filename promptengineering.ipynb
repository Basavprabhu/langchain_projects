GDP is a measure of a country's economic performance and it represents the total value of all goods and services produced within the borders of a country within a specific period of time, usually a year.\\n\\nGDP is calculated by adding up the value of all final goods and services produced in a country. This includes everything from food and clothing to cars and houses. It also takes into account the value of services such as healthcare, education, and transportation.\\n\\nThere are two ways to measure GDP: through the expenditure approach and the income approach. The expenditure approach adds up the total amount of money spent on goods and services in a country, while the income approach calculates the total income earned by individuals and businesses in a country.\\n\\nGDP is an important indicator of a country's economic health as it reflects the overall level of economic activity and growth. A higher GDP usually indicates a stronger economy, while a lower GDP suggests a weaker economy.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that GDP per capita, which is calculated by dividing the total GDP by the population, gives a better understanding of the standard of living in a country.
